	abstract = {By using the trading data and corporate financial data from 2010 to 2022 in Korean stock market, we combine the Bayesian learning process with the DSSW model to investigate the size and specific manifestations of the disposition effect when market belief is different from investors' irrational beliefs. We find that there is a significant negative correlation between investor sentiment and the investor disposition effect. Moreover, affected by sentiment, the performance of investor disposition effect in the bull market and the bear market is quite opposite. The conclusion of this paper has certain theoretical and practical significance for understanding the disposition effect of investors, optimizing investors' selling decisions, and strengthening the construction of a basic system of the capital market. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {As a model-free algorithm, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent learns and makes decisions by interacting with the environment in an unsupervised way. In recent years, DRL algorithms have been widely applied by scholars for portfolio optimization in consecutive trading periods, since the DRL agent can dynamically adapt to market changes and does not rely on the specification of the joint dynamics across the assets. However, typical DRL agents for portfolio optimization cannot learn a policy that is aware of the dynamic correlation between portfolio asset returns. Since the dynamic correlations among portfolio assets are crucial in optimizing the portfolio, the lack of such knowledge makes it difficult for the DRL agent to maximize the return per unit of risk, especially when the target market permits short selling (i.e., the US stock market). In this research, we propose a hybrid portfolio optimization model combining the DRL agent and the Black-Litterman (BL) model to enable the DRL agent to learn the dynamic correlation between the portfolio asset returns and implement an efficacious long/short strategy based on the correlation. Essentially, the DRL agent is trained to learn the policy to apply the BL model to determine the target portfolio weights. In this model, we formulate a specific objective function based on the environment’s reward function, which considers the return, risk, and transaction scale of the portfolio. Our DRL agent is trained by propagating the objective function’s gradient to the policy function of our DRL agent. To test our DRL agent, we construct the portfolio based on all the Dow Jones Industrial Average constitute stocks. Empirical results of the experiments conducted on real-world United States stock market data demonstrate that our DRL agent significantly outperforms various comparison portfolio choice strategies and alternative DRL frameworks by at least 42% in terms of accumulated return. In terms of the return per unit of risk, our DRL agent significantly outperforms various comparative portfolio choice strategies and alternative strategies based on other machine learning frameworks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes three machine learning-based uncertainty set construction methods and a novel uncertainty quantification method for robustness-based optimization. The proposed methods are capable of capturing all possible types of uncertainties in the form of sparse point and/or interval data and efficiently quantify uncertainty in robustness-based optimization. In contrast to traditional approaches that rely on expert opinion or assumptions to construct uncertainty sets, our methods leverage machine learning algorithms to extract uncertainty patterns from historical data and effectively capture epistemic uncertainty in input variables. Another challenge in existing robustness-based optimization under epistemic uncertainty is the high computational cost associated with the iterative method of epistemic analysis. Moreover, these methods struggle with uncertainty sets containing a mixture of point and interval data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified probabilistic approach that utilizes maximum likelihood estimation to efficiently quantify uncertainty, regardless of the data form. Using the proposed methods, we introduce new approaches for robustness-based portfolio optimization (RPO) and multidisciplinary design optimization (RO/MDO), namely the worst-case maximum likelihood estimation (WMLE)-based single-loop RPO and WMLE-based RO/MDO approach, respectively. Illustrated through applications to minimum variance portfolios, our methods consistently demonstrate significant improvements over established formulations in terms of both return and risk. Additionally, when applied to a complex multidisciplinary engineering design, the WMLE-based RO/MDO approach showcases a computationally efficient solving technique, yielding more realistic results than the existing methodologies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Portfolio management is a critical aspect of investment strategies, with the goal to balance the low-risk and high-return investments. Despite this, existing portfolios frequently overlook the integration of stock selection outcomes and underutilize data from listed companies, leading to suboptimal portfolio performance. Addressing these shortcomings, this paper introduces a hybrid system involving stock selection and portfolio optimization. In stock selection, the system employs a combination of convolutional neural network and bi-directional recurrent neural network to predict stock trends. This approach enables the identification of stocks likely to appreciate in value, setting the stage for their inclusion in the subsequent optimization process. For portfolio optimization, the study formulates a five-objective optimization problem that incorporates mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and distance-to-default as key considerations. To solve the many-objective constrained optimization problem, an advanced strategy employing a static penalty function and an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) based on tent chaotic mapping is utilized. The efficacy of the proposed hybrid system is rigorously tested through three sets of ablation experiments alongside two discussions focused on its robustness and computational efficiency. The findings from these investigations reveal that the hybrid system outperforms traditional approaches, reducing risks and improving returns for investors. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In the stock market, it can be challenging to predict stock trends and identify stocks with investment potential due to uncertainty and risk. Accurate predictive models and reliable asset preselection methods are essential for portfolio management. This paper proposes an integration of the deep learning model, the three-way decision (3WD) theory, and the Mean-Variance (MV) method for asset preselection and optimal asset allocation. In the initial stage, an attention-based Encoder–Decoder model is used to predict asset returns and calculate volatility. It outperforms other benchmark models regarding relative error, absolute error, and directional accuracy. The subsequent stage involves selecting stocks based on expected returns and volatility characteristics. The 3WD theory is then used to identify the delayed decision set for implementing additional investment strategies to hedge portfolio risk and enhance returns. Finally, the MV model is employed for investment portfolio optimization. The proposed model is validated using a substantial dataset from the A-share market's SSE 50 Index from January 2010 to December 2022. Results indicate that the proposed model outperforms benchmark models in terms of daily average returns, annualized Information ratio, Sortino ratio, and other aspects under certain trading costs. However, further exploration is required to establish a mechanism that limits the quantity of preselected assets to ensure its broad applicability. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

This composite approach allows the construction of a diversified portfolio and determines an optimal allocation strategy making it possible to minimize the conditional risk of the portfolio and maximize the return. The out-of-sample prediction experiments show that the composite factorial HMM approach performs better, in terms of prediction accuracy, than some other baseline methods presented in the literature. Moreover, our results show that the proposed methodology provides the best performing crypto-asset allocation strategies and it is also clearly superior to the existing methods in VaR and ES predictions. © 2024 International Academic Press.

Yet this approach can encounter the error maximization problem. We combine the steps in a single unified feedforward network, called end-to-end. Two variants are examined: a model-free neural network, and a model-based network in which a risk budgeting model is embedded as an implicit layer in a deep neural network. We performed computational experiments with major ETF indices and found that the model-based approach leads to robust performance out-of-sample (2017–2021) when maximizing the Sharpe ratio as the training objective, achieving Sharpe ratio of 1.16 versus 0.83 for a pure risk budgeting model. Simulation studies show statistically significant difference between model-based and model-free approaches as well. We extend the end-to-end algorithm by filtering assets with low volatility and low returns, boosting the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio to 1.24. The end-to-end approach can be readily applied to a wide variety of financial and other optimization problems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

Developments in the research of portfolio optimization techniques introduced models that consider factors such as market state and asset selection. We then explore and integrate these portfolio optimization methods and techniques into our research. In this study, we propose a portfolio optimization method which optimizes a portfolio given the market state and selects assets based on asset correlation to ensure the diversification of assets in the portfolio. We use machine learning techniques in modelling market states and in the portfolio optimization process. Different market states have different statistical distributions since markets go through bull and bear states, where the value of assets in the market tend to rise or fall respectively. To model the non-stationary nature of the market, we cluster time periods and classify them into market states based on the statistical properties of the stock returns. Market states have varying statistical distributions of returns, so we train a portfolio optimizer in each market state. To optimize the portfolio, we use the Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering method to group correlated assets together. Afterwards, we select lowly correlated assets with high historical Hierarchical Momentum to construct our portfolio. The constructed portfolio then had a higher Sharpe ratio and mean return than the 1n equally weighted portfolio with comparable variances when tested in sample. By selecting lowly correlated assets with high Sharpe ratios and considering the market state at a given investment period, we then show that a diverse portfolio with high returns can be generated with the proposed method.  © 2024 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: This is the first article to apply a machine learning approach to the analysis of time on market on real estate markets. Design/methodology/approach: The random survival forest approach is introduced to the real estate market. The most important predictors of time on market are revealed and it is analyzed how the survival probability of residential rental apartments responds to these major characteristics. Findings: Results show that price, living area, construction year, year of listing and the distances to the next hairdresser, bakery and city center have the greatest impact on the marketing time of residential apartments. The time on market for an apartment in Munich is lowest at a price of 750 € per month, an area of 60 m2, built in 1985 and is in a range of 200–400 meters from the important amenities. Practical implications: The findings might be interesting for private and institutional investors to derive real estate investment decisions and implications for portfolio management strategies and ultimately to minimize cash-flow failure. Originality/value: Although machine learning algorithms have been applied frequently on the real estate market for the analysis of prices, its application for examining time on market is completely novel. This is the first paper to apply a machine learning approach to survival analysis on the real estate market. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In-depth theoretical and practical research is nowadays being performed on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which have the potential to surpass traditional, classical, algorithms on a variety of problems, in physics, chemistry, biology, and optimization. Because they are hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, it takes a certain set of optimal conditions for their full potential to be exploited. For VQAs, the construction of an appropriate ansatz in particular is crucial, since it lays the ground for efficiently solving the particular problem being addressed. To prevent severe negative effects that hamper quantum computation, the substantial noise, together with the structural limitations, characteristic of currently available devices must be also taken into consideration while building the ansatz. In this work the effect of the quantum hardware structure, namely the topological properties emerging from the couplings between the physical qubits and the basis gates of the device itself, on the performances of VQAs is addressed. Specifically, it is here experimentally shown that a complex connectivity in the ansatz, albeit being beneficial for exploring wider sets of solutions, introduces an overhead of gates during the transpilation on a quantum computer that increases the overall error rate, thus undermining the quality of the training. It is hence necessary, when implementing a variation quantum learning algorithm, to find the right balance between a sufficiently parametrized ansatz and a minimal cost in terms of resources during transpilation. Moreover, the experimental finding allows to construct a heuristic metric function, which aids the decision-making process on the best possible ansatz structure to be deployed on a given quantum hardware, thus fostering a more efficient application of VQAs in realistic situations. The experiments are performed on two widely used variational algorithms, the VQE (variational quantum eigensolver) and the VQC (variational quantum classifier), both tested on two different problems, the first on the Markowitz portfolio optimization using real-world financial data, and the latter on a classification task performed on the Iris dataset. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can be used to extract deep features that can be incorporated into reinforcement learning systems to enable improved decision-making; DRL can therefore also be used for managing stock portfolios. Traditional methods cannot fully exploit the advantages of DRL because they are generally based on real-time stock quotes, which do not have sufficient features for making comprehensive decisions. In this study, in addition to stock quotes, we introduced stock financial indices as additional stock features. Moreover, we used Markowitz mean-variance theory for determining stock correlation. A three-agent deep reinforcement learning model called Collaborative Multi-agent reinforcement learning-based stock Portfolio management System (CMPS) was designed and trained based on fused data. In CMPS, each agent was implemented with a deep Q-network to obtain the features of time-series stock data, and a self-attention network was used to combine the output of each agent. We added a risk-free asset strategy to CMPS to prevent risks and referred to this model as CMPS-Risk Free (CMPS-RF). We conducted experiments under different market conditions using the stock data of China Shanghai Stock Exchange 50 and compared our model with the state-of-the-art models. The results showed that CMPS could obtain better profits than the compared benchmark models, and CMPS-RF was able to accurately recognize the market risk and achieved the best Sharpe and Calmar ratios. The study findings are expected to aid in the development of an efficient investment-trading strategy. © The Author(s) 2024.},

The introduction highlights the growing importance of AI in finance, highlighting its benefits in data collection, AI model development, and performance evaluation. The article's development examines data collection in detail, highlighting the use of historical and real-time sources to power AI models. Model development methods are presented, highlighting approaches such as neural networks, SVMs, genetic algorithms, natural language processing, reinforcement learning models, decision tree ensembles, and semantic knowledge networks. AI in finance transcends the boundaries of technological innovation, optimizing decision-making, strengthening financial security, improving operational efficiency, and personalizing financial services for customers. Developmental paragraphs highlight the importance of AI in fraud detection and prevention, process automation, and personalization of financial services. A detailed section explores the different AI models applied to portfolio management, such as neural networks, SVMs, genetic algorithms, natural language processing-based models, reinforcement learning models, sets of decision trees, and semantic knowledge networks. Comparing the results obtained by AI models with traditional approaches highlights the transformation of the financial landscape towards more sophisticated and adaptive methods. We present the emerging context of smart taxation and highlight the importance of research as an essential driver of its development. By highlighting current gaps in traditional approaches to taxation, we introduce the need to explore new AI-based methods to improve the efficiency of the system. The article then analyzes the advantages and limitations of the proposed models, highlighting the ability of AI models to process massive volumes of data in real time and dynamically adapt to market changes.

We show that disaster learning reconciles key stylized facts about macroeconomic quantities and financial markets. For macroeconomic quantities, during the crisis, the decline in aggregate investments is much worse than that of output, whereas the decline in aggregate consumption is moderate relative to that of output. Additionally, the model endogenously features lower consumption volatility and higher investment volatility than that of output. For financial markets, belief updating over a rare disaster produces a higher equity premium, lower risk-free rate, and more volatile stock returns. Finally, we show that jump intensity uncertainty accounts for a substantial fraction of the total welfare cost of rare disasters. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {We consider the classical multi-asset Merton investment problem under drift uncertainty, i.e. the asset price dynamics are given by geometric Brownian motions with constant but unknown drift coefficients. The investor assumes a prior drift distribution and is able to learn by observing the asset prize realizations during the investment horizon. While the solution of an expected utility maximizing investor with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) is well known, we consider the optimization problem under risk and ambiguity preferences by means of the KMM (Klibanoff et al., 2005) approach. Here, the investor maximizes a double certainty equivalent. The inner certainty equivalent is for given drift coefficient, the outer is based on a drift distribution. Assuming also a CRRA type ambiguity function, it turns out that the optimal strategy can be stated in terms of the solution without ambiguity preferences but an adjusted drift distribution. To the best of our knowledge an explicit solution method in this setting is new. We rely on some duality theorems to prove our statements. Based on our theoretical results, we are able to shed light on the impact of the prior drift distribution as well as the consequences of ambiguity preferences via the transfer to an adjusted drift distribution, i.e. we are able to explain the interaction of risk and ambiguity preferences. We compare our results with the ones in a pre-commitment setup where the investor is restricted to deterministic strategies. It turns out that (under risk and ambiguity aversion) an infinite investment horizon implies in both cases a maximin decision rule, i.e. the investor follows the worst (best) Merton fraction (over all realizations of it) if she is more (less) risk averse than a log-investor. We illustrate our findings with an extensive numerical study. © 2024 The Author(s)},

The separable components of age–period–cohort models provide a framework for integrated credit risk modeling across an organization. Using a panel data structure, credit risk scores can be integrated with an APC framework using either logistic regression or machine learning. Such APC scores for default, payoff, and other key rates fit naturally into forward-looking cash flow estimates. Given an economic scenario, every applicant at the time of origination can be assigned profit and profit volatility estimates so that underwriting can truly be account-level. This process optimizes the most fallible part of underwriting, which is setting cutoff scores and assigning loan pricing and terms. This article provides a summary of applications of APC models across portfolio management roles, with a description of how to create the models to be directly integrated. As a consequence, cash flow calculations are available for each account, and cutoff scores can be set directly from portfolio financial targets. © 2024 by the author.},

	abstract = {How can we leverage inherent frequency features of stock signals for effective portfolio optimization? Portfolio optimization in the domain of finance revolves around strategically allocating assets to maximize returns. Recent advancements highlight the efficacy of deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL) in capturing temporal asset patterns for portfolio optimization. However, previous methodologies focusing on time-domain often fail to detect sudden market shifts and abrupt events because their models are overly tailored to prevalent patterns, resulting in significant losses. In this paper, we propose FreQuant (Adaptive Portfolio Optimization via Multi-Frequency Quantitative Analysis), an effective deep RL framework for portfolio optimization that fully operates in the frequency domain, tackling the limitations of time domain-focused models. By bringing the analysis into the frequency domain with the Discrete Fourier Transform, our framework captures both prominent and subtle market frequencies, enhancing its adaptability and stability in response to market shifts. This approach allows FreQuant to adeptly identify primary asset patterns while also effectively responding to less common and abrupt market events, providing a more accurate and comprehensive asset representation. Empirical validation on diverse real-world trading datasets underscores the remarkable performance of FreQuant, showing its superiority in terms of profitability. Notably, FreQuant achieves up to 2.1x higher Annualized Rate of Return and 2.9x higher Portfolio Value than the best-performing competitors.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

It employs decision tree-based and metaheuristic optimization algorithms to create an efficient stock-selection framework grounded in financial analysis. This approach offers a profitable investment strategy integrated with portfolio optimization while systematically lowering the portfolio investment threshold. In this framework, a web crawler was deployed to gather daily closing prices of stocks from the Taiwan Stock Exchange, along with monthly revenue data and financial statements. Subsequently, decision tree-based models were utilized to pinpoint the fundamental financial indicators with significant explanatory power over revenues. The stock selection conditions aligned with these indicators were optimized through a newly developed metaheuristic algorithm named the forensic-based investigation (FBI) optimizer. The optimal conditions were subsequently integrated with the equal-weighting scheme, mean-variance method, and hierarchical risk parity to identify the most effective investment portfolio strategies. Backtesting results showed that the proposed stock-portfolio investment strategy, optimized through machine learning and a metaheuristic algorithm, is well-suited for construction and all-stock categories.

	abstract = {Accurate stock movement prediction is essential to profit from the stock market. However, this task is challenging due to the complexity and non-stationary nature of the market. Deep learning methods have obtained more attention and success in mining price movement patterns.However, some limitations affect their performances. In general, the stock market is ever-changing, and many factors affect stock movement, so capturing the stock movement patterns is hard without enough prior information. To tackle it, we consider employing economic facts to help improve the deep learning method. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Deep learning Model that fuses Economic Facts (HDMEF) to predict stock movement from the micro to the macro tiers: the individual, industry, and whole market tiers. Specifically, we present three well-designed modules to separately model them based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the herding effects, and the holiday effects in the stock market. Experiments on the A-share CSI300 and CSI500 indexes demonstrate that our proposed method performs best on all test phases compared with previous competitive baselines, even an absolute improvement of 2%–3% on some test phases where all the baselines act poor, proving our method is more efficient and robust in different market conditions. In addition, we do an ablation study to analyze the role of various economic effects used in our model, and the results prove that each module is helpful for prediction. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Our findings revealed that the EGARCH (2,2) model excelled in time-series analysis of the IVIX index with regression models and statistical analyses. Moreover, we developed price options for call and put positions based on the IVIX index using the Heston-Jump diffusion model and Monte Carlo Simulations. We further develop a Delta hedging strategy based on these calculations. To establish the efficacy of these options and the strategy, we conducted empirical tests on the CSI 300 index.

More specifically, we consider the adjusted for skewness Sharpe ratio, which incorporates the third moment of the returns distribution, and the adjusted for skewness and kurtosis Sharpe ratio, which exploits in addition the fourth moment. Further, we account for two types of real-world trading constraints. On the one hand, we impose stock market restrictions through cardinality, buy-in thresholds, and budget constraints. On the other hand, a turnover threshold restricts the total allowed amount of trades in the rebalancing phases. To deal with these asset allocation models, we embed a novel hybrid constraint-handling procedure into an improved dynamic level-based learning swarm optimizer. A repair operator maps candidate solutions onto the set characterized by the first type of constraints. Then, an adaptive ℓ1 -exact penalty function manages turnover violations. The focus of the paper is to highlight the importance of including higher-order moments in the performance measures for long-run investments, in particular when the market is turbulent. We carry out empirical tests on two worldwide sets of assets to illustrate the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed strategies, and to evaluate the performance of our investments compared to the strategy maximizing the Sharpe ratio. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The model allows investors to provide their insights by creating a subjective view of future expected returns from their knowledge and personal experience.

Some recent developments in finance have used machine learning techniques to estimate the expected returns and incorporate the investor’s views in new and innovative ways. In this article, the authors propose a new method to find the investor’s views using a combination of the long short-term memory model with support vector regression for use as inputs to the Black–Litterman model. Then the model is tested in two different markets: an emerging market (SET Index of the Thai equity market) and a developed market (Dow Jones Index of the US equity market).

Although solutions have been proposed since the 1950's, recent advances in machine learning are revolutionizing investments. Whereas supervised paradigms such as regression and classification are established in this direction, emerging research suggests that the learning-to-rank (LtR) paradigm can be more effective. Yet, these works are not many and overlook some important aspects. These aspects include the risk inherent in stocks, feature representation, portfolio cardinality and allocation. Addressing these gaps, this paper presents Stochastic-Aware Bootstrap Ensemble Ranking (SABER), an LtR method that directly minimizes the uncertainty and improves ranking performance. In addition, we propose Merged Bootstrap Selection for dynamic portfolio cardinality optimization. Trained on macroeconomic, fundamental and market indicators, the proposed methods outperform a state-of-the-art LtR approach, reaching annual returns and volatility of 83.48% and 29.89% across 6 years. The former also considers renowned weight allocation methods and achieves Sharpe and Sortino ratios of 2.79 and 5.28 respectively. Finally, the computational complexity of the proposed method is proven comparable to that of current methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Our method, which considers highly correlated short datasets, trains the dictionary simultaneously for multiple assets, resulting in more robust and adaptive denoising. We next use a vector auto-regressive process on the denoised data to estimate covariance matrices and build optimal portfolios using the minimum variance approach. Extensive computer simulations are conducted to assess the impact of our denoising method on portfolio performance in terms of several metrics, such as cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and model accuracy. The findings indicate how dictionary learning can improve the robustness of investment portfolios in the face of market noise and volatility. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Selecting profitable stocks for investments is a challenging task. Recent research has made significant progress on stock ranking prediction to select top-ranked stocks for portfolio optimization. However, the stocks are only ranked by predicted stock return, ignoring the stock price volatility risk — a critical aspect for stock selection and investments. Moreover, they preliminarily attempted to capture the effects of related stocks from a singular relation, disregarding the rich information regarding multiple spillover effects from related stocks and the distinctions in effects among various relations. Thus, we propose a risk and return multi-task learning model with a heterogeneous graph attention network (HGA-MT) to predict stock ranking for portfolio optimization. First, to aggregate the multiple spillover effects of related stocks, we introduce graph convolutional networks to fuse the effects of related stocks in each relation and design an attention network to allocate varying weights to different types of relationships. Second, we use a multi-task learning paradigm to learn stock return and volatility risks jointly. The stock ranking results are calculated by simultaneously considering the risk and return. Thus, Top-K ranked stocks are recommended in the portfolio for the next trading day to achieve higher and more stable profits. Extensive experiments prove that HGA-MT outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in stock ranking and backtesting trading evaluation tasks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In the field of empirical asset pricing, the challenges of high dimensionality, non-linear relationships, and interaction effects have led to the increasing popularity of machine learning (ML) methods. This study investigates the performance of ML methods when predicting different measures of stock returns from various factor models and investigates the feature importance and interaction effects among firm-specific variables and macroeconomic factors in this context. Our findings reveal that neural network models exhibit consistent performance across different stock return measures when they rely solely on firm-specific characteristic variables. However, the inclusion of macroeconomic factors from the financial market, real economic activities, and investor sentiment leads to substantial improvements in the model performance. Notably, the degree of improvement varies with the specific measures of stock returns under consideration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that, after the inclusion of macroeconomic factors, there is a dissimilarity in model performance, variable importance, and interaction effects among macroeconomic and firm-specific variables, particularly concerning abnormal returns derived from the Fama–French three- and five-factor models compared with excess returns. This divergence is primarily attributed to the extent to which these factor models remove the variance associated with the macroeconomic variables. These findings collectively offer valuable insights into the efficacy of neural network models for stock return predictions and contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between factor models, stock returns, and macroeconomic conditions in the domain of empirical asset pricing. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Price prediction remains a crucial aspect of financial market research as it forms the basis for various trading strategies and portfolio management techniques. However, traditional models such as ARIMA are not effective for multi-horizon forecasting, and current deep learning approaches do not take into account the conditional heteroscedasticity of financial market time series. In this work, we introduce the similarity embedded temporal Transformer (SeTT) algorithms, which extend the state-of-the-art temporal Transformer architecture. These algorithms utilise historical trends in financial time series, as well as statistical principles, to enhance forecasting performance. We conducted a thorough analysis of various hyperparameters including learning rate, local window size, and the choice of similarity function in this extension of the study in a bid to get optimal model performance. We also experimented over an extended timeframe, which allowed us to more accurately assess the performance of the models in different market conditions and across different lengths of time. Overall, our results show that SeTT provides improved performance for financial market prediction, as it outperforms both classical financial models and state-of-the-art deep learning methods, across volatile and non-volatile extrapolation periods, with varying effects of historical volatility on the extrapolation. Despite the availability of a substantial amount of data spanning up to 13 years, optimal results were primarily attained through a historical window of 1–3 years for the extrapolation period under examination. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Portfolio management is an important financial task, which helps to activate the capital market and boost investor confidence by finding a long-term profitable policy. Reinforcement learning is one of the most prospective method for this task. However, the policy learnt by reinforcement learning lacks robustness, because current studies cannot overcome the distribution shift between the dynamics of the current environment and the future environment. To better tackle this issue, we proposed a method that can align the distributions of different environment dynamics in a pre-trained representation space, thereby enhancing the robustness of the optimal policy in future environments. The key insight of this method is to only extract shared representation between the current and the future, which is the high-level latent information that spans across sequences. This information exists everywhere in the historical sequence, so it can be assumed that it will not disappear in the near future, thus align the distribution of different environment dynamics in this representation space. Such representations are learnt by encoding the current and the future into representations and maximizing their mutual information using probabilistic contrastive loss. Experiments demonstrates the superior performance and universality of our method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Portfolio management (PM) is a fundamental financial trading task, which explores the optimal periodical reallocation of capitals into different stocks to pursue long-term profits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown its potential to train profitable agents for PM through interacting with financial markets. However, existing work mostly focuses on fixed stock pools, which is inconsistent with investors' practical demand. Specifically, the target stock pool of different investors varies dramatically due to their discrepancy on market states and individual investors may temporally adjust stocks they desire to trade (e.g., adding one popular stocks), which lead to customizable stock pools (CSPs). Existing RL methods require to retrain RL agents even with a tiny change of the stock pool, which leads to high computational cost and unstable performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose EarnMore, a rEinforcement leARNing framework with Maskable stOck REpresentation to handle PM with CSPs through one-shot training in a global stock pool (GSP). Specifically, we first introduce a mechanism to mask out the representation of the stocks outside the target pool. Second, we learn meaningful stock representations through a self-supervised masking and reconstruction process. Third, a re-weighting mechanism is designed to make the portfolio concentrate on favorable stocks and neglect the stocks outside the target pool. Through extensive experiments on 8 subset stock pools of the US stock market, we demonstrate that EarnMore significantly outperforms 14 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of 6 popular financial metrics with over 40% improvement on profit.

Existing offloading schemes mainly focus on selecting edge servers for each offloading task with the goal of optimizing the overall average latency. However, the solutions with the optimal overall average latency may be not the most suitable for all offloading tasks. There is still a possibility that offloading leads to an extreme case of ultra-high latency, which is not acceptable for latency-sensitive applications. To address this problem, we therefore introduce modern portfolio theory (MPT) to jointly consider the overall average latency and potential risks in optimal edge server selection. The task offloading problem is regarded as an investment portfolio with the objective of maximizing the 'return' while minimizing the risk. Combining MPT with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we design two proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based task offloading algorithms to jointly optimize these two objectives. The algorithm computes a portfolio for each mobile user that enables the diversification of edge server selection, thereby minimizing the risk and the average latency. Extensive simulation results based on three real-world trace datasets show that our algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-The-Art solutions and can reduce the overall average latency and the risk by 59% and 85% at most, respectively.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel variant of the teaching–learning-based optimization algorithm, termed BLTLBO, which draws inspiration from the blended learning model, specifically designed to tackle high-dimensional multimodal complex optimization problems. Firstly, the perturbation conditions in the “teaching” and “learning” stages of the original TLBO algorithm are interpreted geometrically, based on which the search capability of the TLBO is enhanced by adjusting the range of values of random numbers. Second, a strategic restructuring has been ingeniously implemented, dividing the algorithm into three distinct phases: pre-course self-study, classroom blended learning, and post-course consolidation; this structural reorganization and the random crossover strategy in the self-learning phase effectively enhance the global optimization capability of TLBO. To evaluate its performance, the BLTLBO algorithm was tested alongside seven distinguished variants of the TLBO algorithm on thirteen multimodal functions from the CEC2014 suite. Furthermore, two excellent high-dimensional optimization algorithms were added to the comparison algorithm and tested in high-dimensional mode on five scalable multimodal functions from the CEC2008 suite. The empirical results illustrate the BLTLBO algorithm’s superior efficacy in handling high-dimensional multimodal challenges. Finally, a high-dimensional portfolio optimization problem was successfully addressed using the BLTLBO algorithm, thereby validating the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2024 by the authors.},

The two-part framework includes a feature extraction network and a full connected network. First, the majority of the previous research on portfolio management based on reinforcement learning has been dedicated to discrete action spaces. We propose a potential solution to the problem of a continuous action space with a constraint (i.e., the sum of the portfolio weights is equal to 1). Second, we explore different feature extraction networks (i.e., convolutional neural network [CNN], long short-term memory [LSTM] network, and convolutional LSTM network) combined with our system, and we conduct extensive experiments on the six kinds of assets, including 16 features. The empirical results show that the CNN performs best in the test set. Last, we discuss the effect of the trading frequency on our trading system and find that the monthly trading frequency has a higher Sharpe ratio in the test set than other trading frequencies. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Banking and stock markets consider gold to be an important component of their economic and financial status. There are various factors that influence the gold price trend and its fluctuations. Accurate and reliable prediction of the gold price is an essential part of financial and portfolio management. Moreover, it could provide insights about potential buy and sell points in order to prevent financial damages and reduce the risk of investment. In this paper, different architectures of deep neural network (DNN) have been proposed based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional-based neural networks (CNN) as a hybrid model, along with automatic parameter tuning to increase the accuracy, coefficient of determination, of the forecasting results. An illustrative dataset from the closing gold prices for 44 years, from 1978 to 2021, is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this method. The grid search technique finds the optimal set of DNNs’ parameters. Furthermore, to assess the efficiency of DNN models, three statistical indices of RMSE, RMAE, and coefficient of determination (R2), were calculated for the test set. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid model (CNN-Bi-LSTM) outperforms other models in total bias, capturing extreme values and obtaining promising results. In this model, CNN is used to extract features of input dataset. Furthermore, Bi-LSTM uses CNN’s outputs to predict the daily closing gold price. © 2024 Amini, Kalantari.

Nevertheless, the intricate nature and specificity of data assets render accurate pricing a formidable challenge. To tackle this challenge, we adopt the “divide and conquer” approach and introduce a heterogeneous ensemble pricing model grounded in clustering strategies to enhance the precision of data asset pricing. Initially, our study generates 15 diverse pricing models as potential candidates, leveraging clustering strategies to achieve an adaptive aggregation of data assets. Notably, we introduce an innovative weight generation strategy based on the concept of universal gravitational force to integrate the pricing results. To validate the effectiveness of our Heterogeneous Clustering Ensemble Gravity-based pricing model (HCEG), we conduct computational experiments on transaction platform data assets. The results unequivocally demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HCEG pricing model in data asset pricing. Furthermore, our study delves deeper into the impact of clustering centers, feature selection, and integration strategies on the performance of the pricing model. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing and enhancing the precision of data asset pricing. © 2024},

While the effectiveness of deep graph learning is recognized across various disciplines, the nuances of vague graph learning - whether its inherent vagueness should be incorporated or disregarded and its influence on deep graph learning efficiency - remain largely unexamined. We fill this gap by introducing a novel decoupled graph learning framework. This is achieved by proposing a matrix-based or a tensor-based fusion module to estimate unobservable node attributes, a hybrid attention mechanism to bridge nodes with both explicit and implicit relationships, and a message-passing mechanism for feature-sensitive transporting. The design principle of decoupling allows it to accommodate ambiguities in any or all of these aspects of node representation, linking, and message passing. Furthermore, we leverage an extensive stock dataset spanning 64 years across the entire U.S. market to assess our framework. This real-world data not only adds a practical dimension to our study but also highlights the effectiveness of vague graph learning. Remarkably, our framework demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms, marking performance enhancements of at least 6.73%, 7.25%, and 11.39% in terms of Rank IC, R2R2, and Rank ICIR, respectively.  © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Every year agribusinesses develop and market new seed varieties with traits desirable for different planting environments. When agribusinesses experiment the new varieties at different farms, data is generated about the performance of these new seed varieties. However, farmers do not have a decision support tool to process the vast amount of yield performance data to make an informed seed variety selection decision for their farm. An informed decision requires accurate estimation of yield performances of seed varieties on the targeted farmland and balancing trade-offs between the expected yield and the risk associated with the seed varieties selected to grow. This research uses a real data set provided by Syngenta—an agribusiness—to create a decision-support tool. The data set used in this research contains yield information of different soybean varieties experimented at different farms located in the Midwest of the US, as well as information on location, soil, and weather conditions prevailing in those farms. In addition to this data, we also surveyed soybean farmers to understand their preferences and current practices in choosing seed varieties to grow in their farms. We are the first to capture and document farmers’ preferences and practices in selecting and growing soybean varieties. The data collected from the survey enabled us to compare the results emerging from the proposed methodology with the status quo practices. Using the Syngenta data and survey responses, this paper proposes an analytics framework that integrates machine learning, clustering, simulation, and portfolio optimization to optimally select soybean varieties to grow at the target farm. We choose a machine learning model, which simulates the yield performance of soybean varieties under different plausible weather scenarios derived from the neighborhood of the target farm. The simulated yields are then used to estimate parameters in a portfolio optimization formulation that selects the optimal portfolio of seed varieties to grow at the target farm. The main methodological contribution of this research is in the development of an approach that integrates machine learning, clustering, simulation, and portfolio optimization to help farmers make an important decision. Specifically, we introduce a novel data-driven simulation-based approach to estimate the parameters needed to solve a portfolio optimization problem. Our analysis indicates that an average farmer will gain as much as $177,369 per year in revenue by utilizing the analytics framework introduced in this research. The methodology developed in this research can be applied to variety selection decisions for other crops and influence farming practice positively. By embracing the machine learning and analytics powered framework introduced in this paper, agribusinesses can position themselves as the innovation leader and create business value by unleashing the potential of the scientific discoveries of agronomy to offer tailored farming decision support to individual farmers. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.

	abstract = {Portfolio management is important for sequential investment decisions in response to fluctuating financial markets. As portfolio management can be formulated as a sequential decision-making problem, it has been addressed using reinforcement learning in recent years. However, reinforcement learning methods face challenges in addressing portfolio management problems considering practical constraints. To overcome the limitations, this study proposes a twin-system approach, establishing a tractable twin that mirrors the original problem but with more manageable constraints and system dynamics. Once an optimized portfolio strategy is achieved within the tractable twin, the proposed mapping function translates it back to the original problem, ensuring the retention of optimized performance. Unlike the previous study, the proposed recurrent reinforcement learning method optimizes the portfolio strategy for a single agent managing all candidate assets. This method allows for comprehensive investment decisions by incorporating the features of candidate assets, leading to a more globally optimized portfolio strategy. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark strategies on the US sector and foreign exchange portfolios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {We survey optimization problems that involve the cardinality of variable vectors in constraints or the objective function. We provide a unified viewpoint on the general problem classes and models, and we give concrete examples from diverse application fields such as signal and image processing, portfolio selection, and machine learning. The paper discusses general-purpose modeling techniques and broadly applicable as well as problem-specific exact and heuristic solution approaches. While our perspective is that of mathematical optimization, a main goal of this work is to reach out to and build bridges between the different communities in which cardinality optimization problems are frequently encountered. In particular, we highlight that modern mixed-integer programming, which is often regarded as impractical due to the commonly unsatisfactory behavior of black-box solvers applied to generic problem formulations, can in fact produce provably high-quality or even optimal solutions for cardinality optimization problems, even in large-scale real-world settings. Achieving such performance typically involves drawing on the merits of problem-specific knowledge that may stem from different fields of application and, e.g., can shed light on structural properties of a model or its solutions, or can lead to the development of efficient heuristics. We also provide some illustrative examples. Copyright © by SIAM.},

In contrast to previous machine-learning-based asset pricing models that make predictions directly on equity returns, CS-LSTM estimates are based on predictions of slope terms from Fama–MacBeth cross-section regressions using 16 stock characteristics as factor loadings. In line with previous studies in the context of the Chinese market, we find illiquidity and short-term momentum to be the most important factors in describing asset returns. By using 274 value-weighted portfolios as test assets, we systematically compare the performances of CS-LSTM and three other candidate models. Our CS-LSTM model consistently delivers better performance than the candidate models and beats the market at all different levels of transaction costs. In addition, we observe that assets with smaller cap are favored by the model. By repeating the empirical analysis based on the top 70% of stocks, our CS-LSTM model remains robust and consistently provides significant market-beating performance. Our findings from the CS-LSTM model have practical implications for the future development of the Chinese stock market and other emerging markets. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Customer preferences are found to evolve over time and correlate with geographical locations. Studying the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences is crucial to engineering design as it provides a dynamic perspective for understanding the trend of customer preferences. However, existing choice models for demand modeling do not take the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences into consideration. Learning-based spatiotemporal data modeling methods usually require large-scale datasets for model training, which are not applicable to small aggregated data, such as the sale records of a product in several regions and years. To fill this research gap, we propose a spatial panel modeling approach to investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences. Product and regional attributes varying in time are included as model inputs to support demand forecasting in engineering design. With case studies using the dataset of small SUVs and compact sedans in China’s automotive market, we demonstrate that the spatial panel modeling approach outperforms other statistical spatiotemporal data models and non-parametric regression methods in goodness of fit and prediction accuracy. We also illustrate a potential design application of the proposed approach in a portfolio optimization of two vehicles from the same producer. While the spatial panel modeling approach exists in econometrics, applying this approach to support engineering decisions by considering spatiotemporal heterogeneity and introducing engineering attributes in demand forecasting is the contribution of this work. Our paper is focused on presenting the approach rather than the results per se. © 2024 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization is an active management strategy that aims to maximize returns and control risk within reasonable limits. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a robust on-policy actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, is gaining popularity in portfolio optimization because it can help reduce emotional biases and take systematic investment actions. However, some research has found that the PPO model cannot achieve such remarkable performance in portfolio optimization as in games or robot control. In this paper, a novel GraphSAGE and DRL coupled model (GRL) is proposed to improve the architecture of the PPO agent by introducing a GraphSAGE-based feature extractor to capture the complex non-Euclidean relationships among market indexes, industry indexes and stocks. In addition, the explainable model SHAP is used to select a few but important features for GRL learning, and a method for generating a static financial graph is defined. This improves the robustness and training efficiency of the GRL model. We provide a holistic performance evaluation for GRL on three datasets using five metrics, i.e., Return On Investment (ROI), Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, and Calmar Ratio. The results show that the GRL model outperforms the Equal Weight strategy and the S&P 500 index. In addition, the results of the comparative analysis show that the Share-Extractor GRL and the Separate-Extractor GRL significantly outperform the PPO baseline without a feature extractor. This implies that integrating a GraphSAGE-based feature extractor into the PPO agent can improve its performance and robustness in portfolio optimization tasks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {E-waste demands urgent attention to devise effective and sustainable waste management solutions. In response to this challenge, the integration of deep learning classifiers emerges as a promising avenue to optimize the planning of e-waste collection. By harnessing the capabilities of deep learning, these classifiers yield enriched navigational insights, facilitating more informed asset allocation and strategic interventions. This synthesis of technology-driven planning holds the potential to address the intricate intricacies of e-waste in a sustainable environmental landscape. Furthermore, the identification of important parts in e-waste helps in improving recycling processes, adding to a more maintainable and harmless ecosystem. To improve the potential efficiency and accuracy in waste collection the proposed methodology of Adaptive V3 and Federated Learning (Adaptive V3 and FL) are proposed to optimize e-waste collecting planning. The Inception V3 structure can enhance the classification of the e-waste, also the L2 regularization is utilized to overcome the overfitting issues. Also, federated learning is employed to improve the performance of the Inception V3 with the L2 Regularization approach. The datasets like the Starter e-waste dataset and the Compressed E-waste dataset are employed for the e-waste classification. The performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and f1-score are utilized for the classification. The overall performance achieved by the proposed method is 98.9 % and this maximized the performance than existing approaches such as DCNN, DLRNN, LSTM as well as BSFC which attained 78.4 %, 78.1 %, 58.6 %, and 39.4 % respectively. This research overcomes the proposed strategy in revolutionizing e-waste collecting, planning, and advancing a technology-driven approach to e-waste management. Further, it is performed to perform the effective e-waste classification with multiple wastes using large equipment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

In the present work, we develop a new performance ratio that simultaneously addresses these two problems when building optimal portfolios. To robustify the portfolio optimization and better represent extreme market scenarios, we simulate a large number of returns via a Monte Carlo method. This is done by obtaining probabilistic return forecasts through a distributional machine learning approach in a big data setting and then combining them with a fitted copula to generate return scenarios. Based on a large-scale comparative analysis conducted on the US market, the backtesting results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed portfolio selection approach against several popular benchmark strategies in terms of both profitability and minimizing systemic risk.

	abstract = {This study employs seven advanced machine learning approaches to conduct numerical predictions of the next-day returns of VIX constant-maturity futures (VIX CMFs) using the term structure information derived from VIX CMFs. Based on precise numerical predictions, this study proposes a new Constrained-Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (C-MVO) trading strategy and tests it against a benchmark long-short trading strategy to evaluate the profitability of the machine learning numerical predictions. This study applies three unique feature sets, each incrementally incorporating the VIX CMFs' term structure features, to individually examine the predictive ability of the seven machine learning models and their backtesting performance. Over a comprehensive 11-year period, the experiment adheres to a strict walk-forward expanding-window methodology for both training and backtesting. The predictive and backtesting results show that four of the seven machine learning models attain a prediction information ratio greater than 0.02, with an average prediction information ratio of 0.037. This result suggests that the VIX CMFs term structure features have predictive power for the next-day returns of VIX CMFs. Moreover, the average C-MVO information ratio is 0.623, and the long-short strategy information ratio is 0.404. This increase in the information ratio under the C-MVO strategy validates the effectiveness of the machine learning models and the C-MVO strategy.  © 2024 Wang et al.

	abstract = {The interplay between a firm's customer portfolio and the firm's performance presents a theoretical conundrum that challenges traditional supply chains. In particular, the role of government customer concentration—how extensively a firm incorporates government entities as part of its customer base—emerges as a pivotal factor with the potential to both bolster and burden firm performance. Analyzing 3,643 firm-year observations from the U.S. Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation, Compustat, and FactSet Revere reveals an inverse U-shaped relationship between government customer concentration and firm performance. Excessive or insufficient government customer concentration adversely impacts performance, suggesting that a strategic balance is essential. Firm size, absorptive capacity, and network embeddedness are crucial in navigating this complex relationship, guiding a firm toward optimizing its government customer portfolio. This research advances the discourse on customer base management, underscoring the essential strategic considerations for firms interacting with government buyers. © 2024 The Authors.

In the literature, there are different approaches to generating scenarios, from historical observations to models that predict the volatility of assets. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to generate one-day-ahead discrete scenarios, which are then used as input in choosing the portfolio that optimises the conditional value at risk (CVaR). Our approach uses machine learning supervised algorithms as forecasting models to predict the realized variance and intraday Kendall correlation of assets. With the predictions, we use an EVT-Copula approach to simulate the multivariate probability distribution of the assets. Our computational experiments suggest that our approach could produce more accurate volatility and correlation forecasts, and lower risk portfolios than traditional literature baselines. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

This paper proposed an intelligent Quantum Finance-based portfolio investment system (QFPIS), which is a combination of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Quantum Finance Theory (QFT) to improve these conditions. There are two major agents embodied in the system: 1) a trading agent based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm to determine investment weighting for different financial products by generating continuous actions; 2) an intelligent agent based on Policy Gradient (PG) algorithm to enact risk control and determine whether to hold current orders by producing discrete actions depend on daily Quantum Price Levels (QPLs). The advantages of incorporating a two-agents system design are to devise stable and realistic fund allocation for different products in portfolio.

	abstract = {Enhanced covariance estimation approaches, such as (non-)linear shrinkage, are well established in the literature. Non-linear shrinkage estimators generally minimize a certain loss function regarding statistical assumptions about the future covariance matrix. At the same time, the problem of covariance estimation is traditionally considered from a rather restrictive view since the only available data to determine the estimation parameters is given by the return history of the actual portfolio constituents. In this study, we propose a novel and purely data-driven perspective on covariance estimation. We present a non-linear shrinkage estimator that determines the estimation parameters using cross validation to be historically optimal on a disjoint dataset of assets according to the given objective, such as minimum variance or maximum risk-adjusted return. We then transfer the historically optimal estimation parameters learned on the disjoint dataset to the actual covariance estimation problem. Thereby, the sample eigenvalues are corrected in a purely data-driven way, agnostic to theoretically derived parameters. Another benefit of focusing on disjoint data is that we address the problem of limited data availability in high-dimensional estimation problems when the number of assets exceeds the history length. Our empirical evaluation, based on a total of six stock market indices and various problem dimensions, shows that our approach outperforms existing cross-sectional estimators in minimizing variance and maximizing risk-adjusted return. While our study is limited to the cross-section, the method of parameter selection using cross validation and transfer learning can also be combined with other estimators, such as time-series methods. © 2024 The Authors},

Many existing statistical models could better describe and forecast the characteristics of volatility, whereas they do not simultaneously account for the long-term memory of volatility, the nonlinear characteristics of high-frequency data, and technical index information during the modeling phase. The purpose of this paper is to use the prediction advantage of deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict the volatility fusing three classes of information, that is, high frequency realized volatility (H), technical indicators (I), and the parameters of generalized autoregression conditional heteroskedasticity(GARCH), heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR), and c, resulting in a novel LSTM-HIT model to forecast realized volatility. We employ the extreme value theory (EVT) of a semiparametric method to estimate the quantile of standardized return and construct the LSTM-HIT-EVT model to forecast the value at risk (VaR). Empirical results show that the LSTM-HIT model provides the most accurate volatility forecast among the various considered models and that the LSTM-HIT-EVT model yields forecasts more accurate than other VaR models. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to enhance the understanding of volatility dynamics in commodity returns, such as gold and cocoa, as well as the financial market index S&P500. It provides a comprehensive overview of each model’s efficacy in capturing volatility clustering, asymmetry, and long-term memory effects in asset returns. By employing models like sGARCH, eGARCH, gjrGARCH, and FIGARCH, the research offers a nuanced understanding of volatility evolution and its impact on asset returns. Using the Skewed Generalized Error Distribution (SGED) in model optimization shows how important it is to understand asymmetry and fat-tailedness in return distributions, which are common in financial data. Key findings include the sGARCH model being the preferred choice for Gold Futures due to its lower AIC value and favorable parameter estimates, indicating significant volatility clustering and a slight positive skewness in return distribution. For Cocoa Futures, the FIGARCH model demonstrates superior performance in capturing long memory effects, as evidenced by its higher log-likelihood value and lower AIC value. For the S&P500 Index, the eGARCH model stands out for its ability to capture asymmetry in volatility responses, showing superior performance in both log-likelihood and AIC values. Overall, identifying superior modeling approaches like the FIGARCH model for long memory effects can enhance risk management strategies by providing more accurate estimates of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). Additionally, the out-of-sample evaluation reveals that Support Vector Regression (SVR) outperforms traditional GARCH models for short-term forecasting horizons, indicating its potential as an alternative forecasting tool in financial markets. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate modeling techniques tailored to specific asset classes and forecasting horizons. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of advanced techniques like SVR in enhancing forecasting accuracy, thus offering valuable implications for portfolio management and risk assessment in financial markets. © 2024 by the author.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has become a key tool in solving the complex problem of automated dynamic portfolio selection. However, most existing works rely on data from a limited number of asset classes and cover constrained investment time frames to train their models. Additionally, these models are often trained from randomly initialised weights and lack intuitive explainability regarding the outputs they generate. This research introduces a novel methodology aimed at maximising long-term risk-adjusted investment returns while preserving the explainability of model output. We adopt established rule-based strategies to generate neural network mimics through imitation learning, transferring expert knowledge. These “tutor” models are then enhanced using a hybrid reinforcement learning algorithm combining Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), with the goal of creating “student” models that outperform their tutors. The intuitive explainability of the model is robust as it is trained on the rule-based algorithmic tutor model, unlike other models trained from scratch with randomly initialised weights. We empirically validate the strength of our strategy employing a broad range of asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, US treasuries, commodities, and their leveraged equivalents, simulated on a nearly 40-year price dataset. The benefits of the new model are clear, with the results showing a performance improvement of up to 39.70% in the test set by the Sharpe ratio and up to 47.07% by the Sortino ratio. This work highlights the potential of integrating established strategies with advanced machine learning for a data-driven approach to asset management. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have applied machine learning techniques to online portfolio selection (OLPS), aiming to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of portfolio management in the digital field. In this study, we design and implement a novel OLPS algorithm called “online adaptive asset tracking algorithm” (OAAT). Compared to the peak price tracking (PPT) algorithm, it complements more historical information of assets in the investment portfolio and provides a more effective solution for parameter selection of the PPT algorithm. Firstly, the OAAT algorithm updates investment proportions by tracking the historical information of assets, which includes recent peak prices, historical returns, and historical volatility. Secondly, the OAAT algorithm optimizes parameters through online learning. The initial parameters are selected based on the minimum sum principle of the ordinal information. After each phase of trading, the parameters are optimized through the gradient descent algorithm, and the average values of the optimal parameters in the last 5 days are used as the parameters of the next phase. Finally, with the optimized parameters and the tracked asset information, the fast error backpropagation algorithm outputs the investment ratio through gradient projection. Compared with the benchmarks, follow-the-winner, follow-the-loser, and pattern-matching-based algorithms under four Hong Kong stock index constituents data sets and three US stock index constituents data sets, the empirical comparative analysis and statistical test show that the OAAT algorithm can effectively determine the investment proportion to balance return and risk. © The Author(s) 2023.},

The GRACE method first learns the conditional quantiles and mean of stock returns via a factor-augmented temporal graph convolutional network, which is guided by the set of stock-to-stock relations as well as the set of factor-to-stock relations. Next, the GRACE method learns the conditional variance, skewness, and kurtosis of stock returns from the learned conditional quantiles via the quantiled conditional moment method. Finally, the GRACE method uses the learned conditional mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis to construct several performance measures, which are criteria to sort the stocks to proceed the portfolio selection in the well-known 10-decile framework. An application to NASDAQ and NYSE stock markets shows that the GRACE method performs much better than its competitors, particularly when the performance measures are comprised of conditional variance, skewness, and kurtosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning has been explored for many problems, from video games with deterministic environments to portfolio and operations management in which scenarios are stochastic; however, there have been few attempts to test these methods in banking problems. In this study, we sought to find and automatize an optimal credit card limit adjustment policy by employing reinforcement learning techniques. In particular, because of the historical data available, we considered two possible actions per customer, namely increasing or maintaining an individual's current credit limit. To find this policy, we first formulated this decision-making question as an optimization problem in which the expected profit was maximized; therefore, we balanced two adversarial goals: maximizing the portfolio's revenue and minimizing the portfolio's provisions. Second, given the particularities of our problem, we used an offline learning strategy to simulate the impact of the action based on historical data from a super-app (i.e., a mobile application that offers various services from goods deliveries to financial products) in Latin America to train our reinforcement learning agent. Our results, based on the proposed methodology involving synthetic experimentation, show that a Double Q-learning agent with optimized hyperparameters can outperform other strategies and generate a non-trivial optimal policy not only reflecting the complex nature of this decision but offering an incentive to explore reinforcement learning in real-world banking scenarios. Our research establishes a conceptual structure for applying reinforcement learning framework to credit limit adjustment, presenting an objective technique to make these decisions primarily based on data-driven methods rather than relying only on expert-driven systems. We also study the use of alternative data for the problem of balance prediction, as the latter is a requirement of our proposed model. We find the use of such data does not always bring prediction gains. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

It is difficult to predict the economic condition of the country and hence the company’s financial position. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates clustering techniques, deep learning, and a metaheuristic algorithm to enhance the process of asset selection and allocation. First, S&P BSE 500 index companies have been clustered into ten groups by using the Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering technique based on 11 fundamental characteristics of the companies. The Prowess financial database has been used to collect the required data. For diversification of the portfolio across clusters and sectors, the best-performing companies are chosen based on Sharpe Ratio. Advanced analytical tools like machine learning and deep learning have been employed to increase the accuracy and precision of estimating the returns on the stocks of the selected companies. The expected return on stocks of these selected companies has been estimated with the help of Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Interpretable Time Series (N-BEATS), a deep learning neural network-based forecasting technique. A portfolio multi-objective optimization model has been formulated by considering entropy and higher moments like skewness and kurtosis in the objective function. A metaheuristic algorithm named multi-verse is used to solve the optimization model, and hence the selection of the assets with their proportion of investment in the portfolio has been suggested under different scenarios. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden 2023.},

Given the positive results achieved by machine learning algorithms, deep learning, and time series in predicting stock returns, this article used three methods that performed better than in most studies in the field of stock return prediction. Long short-term memory models are used in deep learning, random forests in machine learning, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models in time series. This article compares forecasting models in order to determine which model is more accurate and then predicts the returns based on that model. This article combines their predictive results with risk and ambiguity metrics in order to develop optimization models. An evaluation was conducted based on historical data for the six-year period from 2017 to 2022 for the top five industries in the Iranian stock market. According to the experiments, the deep learning model performed better than other models when it came to long-term predictions.

Second, we show that higher levels of EPU are associated with higher attention to the overall stock market and lower firm-level attention, in line with category learning behavior. Forecast errors also have a larger firm-specific component during periods of high EPU. Finally, we show that the trading volume and price responses to earnings announcements hardly depend on EPU.

	abstract = {The accuracy of price forecasts is important for financial market trading strategies and portfolio management. Compared to traditional models such as ARIMA and other state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, temporal Transformers with similarity embedding perform better for multi-horizon forecasts in financial time series, as they account for the conditional heteroscedasticity inherent in financial data. Despite this, the methods employed in generating these forecasts must be optimized to achieve the highest possible level of precision. One approach that has been shown to improve the accuracy of machine learning models is ensemble techniques. To this end, we present an ensemble approach that efficiently utilizes the available data over an extended timeframe. Our ensemble combines multiple temporal Transformer models learned within sliding windows, thereby making optimal use of the data. As combination methods, along with an averaging approach, we also introduced a stacking meta-learner that leverages a quantile estimator to determine the optimal weights for combining the base models of smaller windows. By decomposing the constituent time series of an extended timeframe, we optimize the utilization of the series for financial deep learning. This simplifies the training process of a temporal Transformer model over an extended time series while achieving better performance, particularly when accounting for the non-constant variance of financial time series. Our experiments, conducted across volatile and non-volatile extrapolation periods, using 20 companies from the Dow Jones Industrial Average show more than 40% and 60% improvement in predictive performance compared to the baseline temporal Transformer. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

Following the initial success of deep learning models in energy price prediction, we attempt to establish a better architecture of neural networks to improve the prediction accuracy. We propose a novel Parallel Hybrid Neural Network (PHNN) model that utilizes independent sub-networks to effectively capture the distinct features of various sequences. Empirical results demonstrate that the PHNN model exhibits a significant performance enhancement of 16.68%, 14.09%, and 2.34% over the EMD–LSTM, the informer model, and the single LSTM model, respectively. In particular, the PHNN outperforms the single LSTM, which is trained on the same inputs, by 2.34% overall while by a remarkable 4.11% during event periods. This suggests that the PHNN derives notable benefits from its distinct architecture, particularly during the initial phase of extreme events characterized by significant price trend changes. Additionally, the study explores the potential benefits of incorporating additional event-tracking indicators for energy futures price forecasting. However, the findings suggest that these indicators may not consistently provide effective complementary information. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Using an extensive list of anomaly variables, we find that the long-short strategy of buying (shorting) stocks with high (low) deep learning signals generates greater returns for stocks more vulnerable to behavioral biases, i.e., small, young, unprofitable, volatile, non-dividend-paying, close-to-default, and lottery-like stocks. This performance of deep learning models for speculative stocks becomes pronounced when investor sentiment is high, and when new information is delivered through earnings announcements. Moreover, our nonlinear deep learning signals are negatively associated with analysts’ earnings forecast error especially for speculative stocks, implying that analysts’ forecasts are too low for speculative stocks with high deep learning signals.

	abstract = {In the last years, researchers and practitioners have focused on defining portfolio optimization approaches. This task aims to identify a suitable distribution of assets for maximizing profits and minimizing risks, also offering protection against unexpected market behaviors. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art approaches encounter significant limitations due to the complex nature of the task: (1) forecasting of non-stationary, non-linearity and volatile stock price; (2) budget allocation over different stocks satisfying multi-objective objective function; (3) risk costs can significantly affect the effectiveness of the designed approaches. In this paper, we propose a cognitively inspired framework for portfolio optimization by integrating deep learning-based stock forecasting for maximizing the revenue and portfolio diversification and Shape Ratio for minimizing the risk. Furthermore, the cognitively inspired forecasting module relies on the LSTM-based approach which combines historical financial data and technical indicators. Hence, this approach addresses the portfolio optimization task with the aim of designing more and more cognitive agents that perform autonomous actions for supporting decision-making. To make these agents cognitive, we further integrate stock forecasting into the portfolio optimization model, also investigating the main factors affecting both stock forecasting and portfolio optimization tasks. The proposed framework has been evaluated in two stages on a real-world dataset, composed of four years of information about stocks from six different areas. Firstly, we compare the proposed forecasting models based on LSTM and GRU, pointing out that the former achieves higher effectiveness results although the latter has a shorter training time. Finally, the proposed framework has been compared with different baselines, obtaining a net difference of $168 at the maximum. Finally, we compare the proposed approach w.r.t. several baselines in terms of total revenue, also providing an ablation analysis to investigate how stock prediction might support investors in dealing with portfolio optimization task. © The Author(s) 2024.},

This paper proposes an intelligent stock portfolio selection method based on a prediction neural network, incorporating signal processing and hyperparameter optimization techniques. The method is divided into two key stages: stock price prediction and portfolio selection. In the first stage, we apply Savitzky–Golay filtering to denoise price data and reveal its patterns, and optimize the hyperparameters of the long short-term memory network using the sparrow search algorithm to achieve high-precision stock price predictions. In the second stage, we use the mean-Conditional Value-at-Risk (mean-CVaR) model to select the optimal stock allocation, considering factors such as potential returns, prediction accuracy, and growth rate. Numerical comparisons based on multiple public financial datasets demonstrate that the proposed two-stage method significantly outperforms seven benchmark methods. Specifically, on the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 (CSI 300) Index dataset, the proposed method achieves a determination coefficient of 0.9980 and an accuracy rate of 97.05%. Additionally, its cumulative returns reach 9.38%, 8.63%, and 7.54% at different confidence levels. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Portfolio management (PM) is a popular financial process that concerns the occasional reallocation of a particular quantity of capital into a portfolio of assets, with the main aim of maximizing profitability conditioned to a certain level of risk. Given the inherent dynamicity of stock exchanges and development for long-term performance, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a dominating solution for solving the problem of portfolio management in an automated and efficient manner. Nevertheless, the present RL-based PM methods just take into account the variations in prices of portfolio assets and the implications of price variations, while overlooking the significant relationships among different assets in the market, which are extremely valuable for managerial decisions. To close this gap, this paper introduces a novel deep model that combines two subnetworks; one to learn a temporal representation of historical prices using a refined temporal learner, while the other learns the relationships between different stocks in the market using a relation graph learner (RGL). Then, the above learners are integrated into the curriculum RL scheme for formulating the PM as a curriculum Markov Decision Process, in which an adaptive curriculum policy is presented to enable the agent to adaptively minimize risk value and maximize cumulative return. Proof-of-concept experiments are performed on data from three public stock indices (namely S&P500, NYSE, and NASDAQ), and the results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in improving the portfolio management performance over the competing RL solutions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {High volatility presents considerable challenges in the optimization of financial portfolio assets. This study develops and explores model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) in this context. Existing literature suggests that while model-free approach offers certain computational advantages, it frequently fails to encapsulate the nature of highly dynamic capital markets. This limitation is due to an insufficient consideration of the interactions between agents and environmental states within the reinforcement learning framework. Conversely, MBRL encounters inaccuracies representing stochastically evolving states typical of volatile capital markets. To address these limitations, we introduce an innovative AI framework in the MBRL domain by integrating attentive neural processes with continuous-time MBRL. This novel approach, termed Neural Process Continuous Reinforcement Learning (NPCRL), is posited to enhance the ability of MBRL to adapt to volatile fluctuations in capital markets. The effectiveness of NPCRL is empirically evaluated through a series of experiments using three important performance indicators of financial portfolios: returns, risk, and drawdown recovery. The results demonstrate that NPCRL surpasses other methods in achieving a balanced trade-off between long-term returns and risk management. This study advances our understanding of machine learning development by suggesting methods that are more proficient at capturing and adapting in volatile training environments. © 2024},

We adopt a novel automatic debiased machine learning (ADML) method proposed by Chernozhukov, Newey, and Singh (2022) to robustly estimate partial pricing effect of a certain factor controlling for a large number of confounding factors under a nonlinear stochastic discount factor (SDF) assumption. The ADML resolves biased estimation, non-robustness, and overfitting issues that are common to traditional machine learning approaches. We find that the most significant factors selected by the ADML outperform the Fama–French sparse factors and factors identified via the double-selection LASSO method under a linear factor model assumption. Out of a high-dimensional zoo of US stock market factors commonly tested in the finance literature, we identify approximately 30 to 50 factors having significant but declining pricing power in explaining the cross-section of stock returns.

	abstract = {After 2010, the consumer price index fell to a low level in the EU. In the euro area, it remained low between 2010 and 2020. The European Central Bank has even had to take action against the emergence of deflation. The situation changed significantly in 2021. Inflation jumped to levels not seen for 40 years in the EU. Our study aims to use artificial intelligence to forecast inflation. We also use artificial intelligence to forecast stock index changes. Based on the forecasts, we propose portfolio reallocation decisions to protect against inflation. The forecasting literature does not address the importance of structural breaks in the time series, which, among other things, can affect both the pattern recognition and prediction capabilities of various machine learning models. The novelty of our study is that we used the Zivot–Andrews unit root test to determine the breakpoints and partitioned the time series into training and testing datasets along these points. We then examined which database partition gives the most accurate prediction. This information can be used to re-balance the portfolio. Two different AI-based prediction algorithms were used (GRU and LSTM), and a hybrid model (LSTM–GRU) was also included to investigate the predictability of inflation. Our results suggest that the average error of the inflation forecast is a quarter of that of the stock market index forecast. Inflation developments have a fundamental impact on equity and government bond returns. If we obtain a reliable estimate of the inflation forecast, we have time to rebalance the portfolio until the inflation shock is incorporated into government bond returns. Our results not only support investment decisions at the national economy level but are also useful in the process of rebalancing international portfolios. © 2024 by the authors.},

Given the abundant evidence of uncertainty in estimating expected returns, we focus our analyses on the single parameter driving expected returns. After deriving an Uncertainty-Implied GARCH (UI-GARCH) model, we investigate how learning about uncertainty affects investments in a dynamic portfolio optimization problem. We consider an investor with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility who wants to maximize her expected utility from terminal wealth under an Affine GARCH(1,1) model. The corresponding stock evolution, and therefore, the wealth process, is treated as a Bayesian information model that learns about the expected return with each period. We explore the one- and two-period cases, demonstrating a significant impact of uncertainty on optimal allocation and wealth-equivalent losses, particularly in the case of a small sample size or large standard errors in the parameter estimation. These analyses are conducted under well-documented parametric choices. The methodology can be adapted to other GARCH models and applications beyond portfolio optimization. © 2024 by the authors.},

Based on the patterns of jumps and diffusion in stock prices, we propose a dynamic Jump-Diffusion factors model that decomposes volatility into jump and diffusion components. This model aims to capture the characteristics of jump and diffusion risks across different time horizons. We employ the sequential Bayesian learning method to learn asset pricing models and analyze the performance of different decompositions of volatility in elucidating stock price dynamics and option pricing. Based on this study, single-factor models fail to capture diffusion and jump risks simultaneously. Moreover, accounting for the cross-feedback effects between the jump and diffusion components is crucial for capturing the term structure of volatility. The dynamic Jump-Diffusion factors model is capable of capturing the evolution of both jump and diffusion risks and exhibits a more flexible term structure of conditional volatility compared to the Long-run and Short-run component model. The dynamic Jump-Diffusion factors model with cross-feedback effect outperforms the Long-run and Short-run component model in mitigating the upward-sloping term structure of option pricing errors. © 2024 Systems Engineering Society of China.

The proposed model captures the dynamic dependence among multivariate stock returns, especially focusing on the tail-side properties. We also propose a two-step iterative algorithm to train the model and then predict the time-varying model parameters, including the time-invariant tail parameters. At each investment date, we can easily simulate new samples from the learned generative model, and we further perform CVaR portfolio optimization with the simulated samples to form a dynamic portfolio strategy. The numerical experiment on stock data shows that our model leads to wiser investments that promise higher reward-risk ratios and present lower tail risks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

While all methods generate substantial economic gains—unlike in other asset classes—the benefits from model complexity are limited. Return predictability derives mainly from a handful of simple characteristics, such as market price, past alpha, illiquidity, and momentum. Contrary to the stock market, abnormal returns in cryptocurrencies originate from the long leg of the trade and persist over time. Furthermore, despite high portfolio turnover, most machine learning strategies remain profitable after trading costs. However, alphas are concentrated in hard-to-trade assets and critically depend on harvesting extreme returns on small, illiquid, and volatile coins. © 2023},

Based on observable information, a decision-maker learns about the unobservable factor while making investment–consumption decisions. Both factors are supposed to follow a mean-reverting process. Also, we relax the assumption for perfect liquidity of the risky asset through incorporating proportional transaction costs that are incurred in trading the risky asset. In such way, a form of friction posing liquidity risk to the investor is examined. Dynamic programming principle coupled with an Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation are adopted to discuss the problem. Applying an asymptotic method with small transaction costs being taken as a perturbation parameter, we determine the frictional value function by solving the first and second corrector equations. For the numerical implementation of the proposed approach, a Monte-Carlo-simulation-based approximation algorithm is adopted to solve the second corrector equation.

	abstract = {The connection between risk and return is a critical concept in finance. Investors who take on more risk can earn higher returns. Disruptions are part of market risks, also known as systematic risks. Due to political and macroeconomic risks, their effects on the entire economic market, or a significant portion of its sectors, are not negligible. Among these sectors, the stock market is essential as a basis of the economy. The point is that the consequences of all disruptions are not merely unpleasant for companies. They may affect corporate profitability both negatively and positively. Hence, investors who trace companies' news and fundamental conditions react, and the closing price probably encounters volatility. Therefore, the common trend of several stocks may fluctuate. This research investigates how investors in the stock market should form their investment portfolio to see the minor losses when disruptions occur and take advantage of the potential provided profitability by turning threats into opportunities. A three-step framework is presented to achieve this goal. A prerequisite for this framework is the collection of relevant data. Ten stocks from distinct industries of the Securities and Exchange Organization of Iran are chosen for the examination. In the first step, multi-variate regression analysis categorizes selected stocks into the most and the least affected groups. At the same time, a comprehensive technical analysis is involved in this step. Then, in the second step, three well-known machine learning techniques, namely, stacked long short-term memory (Stacked LSTM), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Prophet, are compared from the point of view of predicting future closed prices of selected stocks. The method with the most minor statistical error in forecasting, i.e., root mean squared error (RMSE) and validation loss, estimates the next month's closed prices. Finally, based on the predicted closed prices, the third step empowers the investor to optimize their portfolio in different scenarios, containing various investment weights on the two obtained groups of the first step, using the Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory. The COVID-19 pandemic and currency risk are the two examined real case studies to validate the proposed methodology. Numerical results based on the Sharp Ratio show the superiority of investing 75 percent of an asset in the most affected stocks and the rest in the least affected stocks in the case of a pandemic and vice versa for the case of currency risk, which reveals that according to the unique features of disruptions investors can benefit from both categories of stocks. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: In today’s intricate and dynamic construction sector, traditional project management techniques, which view projects in isolation, are no longer sufficient. Project Portfolio Management (PPM) has proven to be an efficient alternative solution for handling multiple construction projects. As such, based on a Machine Learning (ML) approach, this study aims to explore the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) influencing the adoption of PPM, aiming to enhance PPM implementation in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire based on CSFs gathered from prior studies was developed and validated by experts. Afterward, exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand CSF–PPM relationships. Preprocessing techniques ensure uniformity in variable magnitudes. Lastly, ML techniques, namely Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR) and Extra Trees Classifier (ETC) are developed to model and investigate CSFs' impact on PPM adoption. Findings: The findings pointed out that the ETC model marginally outperforms other ML models with a classification accuracy of 93%. Also, the project size, utilized PPM tool and resource allocation-related factors are the most significant CSFs that influenced the PPM performance by about 48.5%. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by raising awareness among construction companies and other project stakeholders about the pivotal CSFs that must be considered when prioritizing projects and designing an optimal PPM approach. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This article introduces a novel hybrid regime identification-forecasting framework designed to enhance multi-asset portfolio construction by integrating asset-specific regime forecasts. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on broad economic regimes affecting the entire asset universe, our framework leverages both unsupervised and supervised learning to generate tailored regime forecasts for individual assets. Initially, we use the statistical jump model, a robust unsupervised regime identification model, to derive regime labels for historical periods, classifying them into bullish or bearish states based on features extracted from an asset return series. Following this, a supervised gradient-boosted decision tree classifier is trained to predict these regimes using a combination of asset-specific return features and cross-asset macro-features. We apply this framework individually to each asset in our universe. Subsequently, return and risk forecasts which incorporate these regime predictions are input into Markowitz mean-variance optimization to determine optimal asset allocation weights. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through an empirical study on a multi-asset portfolio comprising twelve risky assets, including global equity, bond, real estate, and commodity indexes spanning from 1991 to 2023. The results consistently show outperformance across various portfolio models, including minimum-variance, mean-variance, and naive-diversified portfolios, highlighting the advantages of integrating asset-specific regime forecasts into dynamic asset allocation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

Present works have demonstrated the efficacy of modeling interstock relations for market timeseries forecasting and utilized Graph-based learning models for value prediction and portfolio management. Though convincing, these deterministic approaches still fall short of handling uncertainties i.e., due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the financial data, it is quite challenging to learn effective deterministic models. Since the probabilistic methods have shown to effectively emulate higher uncertainties for timeseries predictions. To this end, we showcase effective utilisation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), to develop an architecture for providing better market predictions conditioned on the historical financial indicators and inter-stock relations. Additionally, we also provide a novel deterministic architecture MaTCHS which uses Masked Relational Transformer(MRT) to exploit inter-stock relations along with historical stock features.

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization has been studied roughly with the emergence of artificial intelligence and data. Traditionally, financial market researchers have used modern portfolio theory to optimize portfolios. However, with the recent development of artificial intelligence, attempts to optimize portfolios with machine learning and especially deep learning and reinforcement learning are increasing. Many studies have been undertaken to create reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning algorithms for portfolio optimization. In fact, many researchers have successfully used reinforcement learning to train an intelligent agent that learns profitable trading strategies from financial market data. In this paper, our aim is to review the research advances made in the application of reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning in information-based decision-making in financial industries and specifically in portfolio optimization. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the major components of a reinforcement learning algorithm as well as the variety of methods and their related terminology. First, we will tackle briefly the terminologies used in the field of portfolio optimization and reinforcement learning. Then, we will provide an overview of the current research methods used for portfolio optimization while analyzing their results and their limitations. This overview will give perspective for future research. © 2024 IEEE.},

In this work, a learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for multi-period portfolio optimization is proposed, where the return prediction model is estimated via a novel trading-oriented learning paradigm. According to such a perspective, the model parameters are not the ones minimizing the prediction error but those that directly maximize the investor's utility.

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization is a strategic approach aiming at achieving an optimal balance between risk and returns through the judicious allocation of limited capital across various assets. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to tackle the complexities of portfolio optimization. Despite its potential, a notable limitation of DRL algorithms is their inherent difficulty in integrating conflicted objectives with the reward functions throughout the learning process. Typically, DRL's reward function prioritizes the maximization of returns or other performance indicators, often overlooking the integration of risk aspects. Furthermore, the standard DRL framework struggles to incorporate practical constraints, such as cardinality and bounding, into the decision process. Without these constraints, the investment strategies developed might be unrealistic and unmanageable. To this end, in this paper, we propose an adaptive and safe DRL framework, which can dynamically optimize the portfolio weights while strictly respecting practical constraints. In our method, any infeasible action (i.e., one that violates the constraints) decided by the RL agent will be mapped to a feasible region using a safety layer. The extended Markowitz Mean-Variance (M-V) model is explicitly encoded in the safety layer to ensure the feasibility of the actions from the alternative views. In addition, we utilize Projection-based Interior-point Policy Optimization (IPO) to resolve multiple objectives and constraints in the examined problem. Extensive results on real-world datasets show that our method is effective in strictly respecting constraints under dynamic market environments, in contrast to prevailing data- driven trading strategies and conventional model-based static solutions. © 2024 IEEE.},

Our findings support the dominance of conventional assets in the correlation with disruptive assets, demonstrated by REITs price movements’ destabilization of the correlation network. Interestingly, this destabilization is concentrated in bear markets, suggesting that while investors trade both cryptocurrencies and REITs in bull markets, investors are likely to hedge their cryptocurrency investments with REITs or avoid cryptocurrencies in bear markets.

	abstract = {Partial index tracking (PIT) is a popular passive investment strategy aiming at replicating the performance of a market index (e.g., S&P 500). Existing PIT methods typically treat it as a regression problem and divide it into two tasks: (i) asset selection (determining which assets to choose from the index constituents) and (ii) asset allocation (deciding how to allocate capital among the selected assets). However, these methods either optimize these two tasks jointly, which has been proven to be NP-hard and inefficient when tracking large-scale constituent indices (e.g., Russell 2000), or attempt an independent optimization, lacking a connection to ensure collaborative optimization. In this paper, we present a hierarchical model for partial index tracking (HIT), which formulates PIT as a hierarchical Markov decision process (MDP) and is optimized via hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). HIT consists of (1) a high-level policy learns to select assets from constituents to handle task (i) and (2) a low-level policy learns to allocate capital weights among the selected assets to handle task (ii). We further propose a novel cost-sensitive reward function that serves as a connection to collaboratively optimize the two policies, aiming to replicate the index closely while considering transaction cost. Compared with existing jointly optimized approaches, our model simplifies the problem by learning separate policies for the two tasks, and the reward function serves as a connection to ensure collaborative optimization between them, avoiding challenges faced by joint optimization methods in existing literature. Remarkable performance across 6 benchmarks, ranging from small to large-scale constituents demonstrate the superiority of HIT. Moreover, the experiments conducted on a real-world market dataset spanning over 10 years show its effectiveness and practicality.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for portfolio management due to its ability to make sequential decisions. However, applying RL techniques to this domain is still challenging due to the non-stationary nature of financial markets. Existing RL-based solutions fail to consider the intrinsic causes behind this non-stationary, which primarily stem from the involvement of diverse traders with distinct investment horizons and their varied investment strategies. In this paper, we tackle the non-stationary problem by examining its intrinsic causes and propose cross-insight trader, a novel two-step RL-based approach that integrates multiple trading policies with different investment horizons to adapt to the changing market conditions. In the first step, we learn multiple horizon-specific policies by providing each policy with tailored information specific to its investment horizon. This allows each policy to recognize dynamic patterns within its respective horizon and make insightful pre-decisions. In the second step, we learn a cross-insight policy to make the final trade decision by considering the investment pre-decisions made by multiple horizon-specific policies in the first step. To enable effective learning of two types of policies, our approach employs a centralized critic to evaluate the actions performed by both horizon-specific and cross-insight policies. By incorporating multiple insights from different investment horizons into the decision-making process, our approach enhances its adaptability to changing market conditions. Experimental results conducted on three stock markets demonstrate the superiority of our framework.  © 2024 IEEE.},

The methodology is applied in a custom trading environment mimicking the CAC-40 index's financial conditions, allowing the model to adapt dynamically to market changes based on iterative learning from historical data. Empirical findings reveal that the model outperforms an equally weighted portfolio in out-of-sample tests. The study offers a dual contribution: it elevates algorithmic planning while significantly boosting transparency and interpretability in financial machine learning. This approach tackles the enduring ‘black-box’ issue and provides a holistic, transparent framework for managing investment portfolios. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In this era of high inflation and low interest rates, the public often invests in financial products to increase their passive income and thus increase their savings. Current data show that the public still considers stocks as investment targets. However, because investment is risky and each person's investment personality (risk tolerance) is different, some prefer to take risks to obtain the maximum return, and some are afraid of risks and avoid them to obtain stable returns; nevertheless, the recommendations of current research give little consideration to the risk characteristics of the investment target and the personal characteristics of the investor. However, investment is a trade-off between risk and reward, and the risk acceptance associated with an investment depends on the investor's ability to accept risk. Therefore, in the context of recommending, a consideration of investors' personal characteristics brings recommendations more in line with users' expectations. This study proposes a method to manage investment portfolios based on investors' risk personalities. It is mainly used to classify stocks according to beta indicators (select stocks according to investors' personalities), and financial indicators and an autoencoder are used to score stocks; moreover, technical indicators, covariance matrices, deep reinforcement learning-advantage actor critic (A2C), and proximal policy optimization (PPO) are used for asset allocation with the aim of developing investment portfolios with good performance that are optimally suitable for different types of investors. In the training results, the cumulative return rate obtained by the A2C model is as high as 49.61% for conservative investments, 82.04% for stable investments, and 99.69% for active investments. The cumulative return obtained by the PPO model is as high as 39.92% for conservative investments, 89.89% for stable investments, and 85.61% for active investments. © 2024 Institute of Information Science.

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to financial portfolio management in recent years. Current studies mostly focus on profit accumulation without much consideration of risk. Some risk-return balanced studies extract features from price and volume data only, which is highly correlated and missing representation of risk features. To tackle these problems, we propose a weight control unit (WCU) to effectively manage the position of portfolio management in different market statuses. A loss penalty term is also designed in the reward function to prevent sharp drawdown during trading. Moreover, stock spatial interrelation representing the correlation between two different stocks is captured by a graph convolution network based on fundamental data. Temporal interrelation is also captured by a temporal convolutional network based on new factors designed with price and volume data. Both spatial and temporal interrelation work for better feature extraction from historical data and also make the model more interpretable. Finally, a deep deterministic policy gradient actor–critic RL is applied to explore optimal policy in portfolio management. We conduct our approach in a challenging non-short-selling market, and the experiment results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both profit and risk criteria. Specifically, with 6.72% improvement on an annualized rate of return, 7.72% decrease in maximum drawdown, and a better annualized Sharpe ratio of 0.112. Also, the loss penalty and WCU provide new aspects for future work in risk control. Copyright © 2024 Ruidan Su et al.},

	abstract = {Quantum-inspired optimization is an emerging computational intelligence technique that achieves quantum advan-tages through inspiration from the mechanisms of quantum properties. Parameter control is vital for optimization methods to address complex problems with extensive solution spaces. However, static parameters lack adaptability, leading to issues like premature convergence, becoming trapped in local optima, and failing to uncover the global optimum. Therefore, we develop a novel adaptive mechanism to dynamically adjust parameters during algorithm execution to strike a remarkable balance between exploration and exploitation. This study first proposes the knowledge-navigated quantum-inspired tabu search (KNQTS) algorithm, which acquires insights from the ongoing process to adjust the environment-sensitive parameters adaptively and non-linearly. Differences between inter-iteration solutions can signal the extent of convergence and guide bidirectional adjustments of a parameter, facilitating the handling of com-plex optimization problems. KNQTS is applied to tackle real-world application portfolio construction problems in the financial technology field. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the substantial potential and robustness of KNQTS in rapidly identifying better solutions with higher probabilities in shorter durations compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. Statistical tests substantiate the significant superiority of KNQTS over these comparative algorithms.  © 2024 IEEE.},

As the society environment becomes even more complex, imperceptible cyber attacks aimed at bottom algorithms are no longer uncommon. However, there is a shortage of attention on adversarial attacks on evolutionary algorithms. For example, a malicious manipulation of datasets can result in a severe performance decline of evolutionary algorithms, significantly impacting the user experience in practical applications. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a framework for adversarial attacks on evolutionary algorithms aimed at countering both single-objective and multi-objective attacked algorithms of real-world optimization problems. To satisfy the requirement of attack effect and imperceptibility, SparseEA is adopted as the attack algorithm. The experimental results on attacking multiple real-world problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

However, employing conventional graph neural network methodologies for effective aggregation and final representation learning of intricately complex financial information within real-world markets proves challenging. This necessitates the optimization of graph structures to enhance the accuracy of parsing and leveraging financial information. In this paper, we propose an asymmetric graph-based deep reinforcement learning for portfolio optimization. Specifically, leveraging the excellent evaluative capabilities of large language models, we decipher multi-dimensional asymmetric relationships between stocks in multi-dimensional data, constructing asymmetric stock relationship graphs based on news and sectors. We then design a multi-dimensional relationship attention mechanism to jointly represent asymmetric graph information and employ deep reinforcement learning for end-to-end portfolio optimization. Extensive experiments on real datasets from China and the United States have demonstrated the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art methods. In the industrial observation conducted at a leading financial technology company, we validated the applicability of our method in real-world market scenarios. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

In this paper, we challenge the ‘estimate-then-optimize’ approach with one that directly optimizes portfolio weights from data. We frame portfolio selection as a constrained penalized regression problem. We present a data-driven approach that automatically performs model selection and hyperparameter tuning to maximize the objective without noisy or potentially misspecified intermediate steps. Finally, we show how the portfolio weights can be optimized using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. Testing on the M6 competition data, our approach achieves a global rate of return of 9.5% and an information ratio of 5.045, which is in stark contrast to the mean IR of the M6 competition teams of −3.421 and the IR of 0.453 for the M6 benchmark. © 2024 International Institute of Forecasters},

	abstract = {Stock market forecasting involves predicting fluctuations and trends in the value of financial assets, utilizing statistical and machine learning models to analyze historical market data for insights into future behavior. This practice aids investors, traders, financial institutions, and governments in making informed decisions, managing risks, and assessing economic conditions. Forecasting financial markets is difficult due to the intricate interplay of global economics, politics, and investor sentiment, making it inherently unpredictable. This study introduces a Deep Learning based Expert Framework for Stock Market forecasting (Portfolio prediction) called DLEF-SM. The methodology begins with an improved jellyfish-induced filtering (IJF-F) technique for preprocessing, effectively analyzing raw data and eliminating artifacts. To address imbalanced data and enhance data quality, pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, VGGFace2 and ResNet-50, are used for feature extraction. Additionally, an improved black widow optimization (IBWO) algorithm is designed for feature selection, reducing data dimensionality and preventing under-fitting. For precise stock market predictions, integrate deep reinforcement learning with artificial neural network (DRL-ANN) is proposed. Simulation outcomes reveal that the proposed framework achieves maximum forecasting accuracy, reaching 99.562%, 98.235%, and 98.825% for S&P500-S, S&P500-L, and DAX markets, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.},

Then we consider a more realistic setting, including non-linear dynamics, that better describes the WTI spot prices time series.

Using these machines learning the methods, including the DRL algorithm, this program is designed to strengthen while making investment choices beyond the limits of the traditional framework, as well as enhancing the decision-making processes in an environment with many uncertainties and dynamics. The study begins with a literature review that is thorough and covers past works on traditional finance portfolio management, market prediction methods, and recent work on DRL in finance. Leveraging this base, we design and implement DRL-V-based models for asset management and market prediction situations. Empirical research includes the construction of models that use historical financial records about stock indexes and macroeconomic data as the main input. We use some of the performance metrics like cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and annualized volatility as the KPIs. We compare them with historical data along with the DRL model's performance and other baseline models as well. The evidence obtained from the experiments proves that DRL-based investment strategies outperform other strategies by their ability to make adjustments for changing market standards and uncovering investment opportunities. Besides the comparative studies, the variety of DRL models used in DFS which perform similar tasks under different market environments has been validated. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Financial literacy is crucial for making sound financial decisions and living a better life. However, the field of finance is full of abstract concepts, such as inflation, liquidity, asset allocation and credit. Abstract concepts may be harder to comprehend than concrete concepts due to their lack of tangible referents in the physical world. In contrast, concrete concepts (e.g., car or house) have a palpable form and can be directly experienced through the senses. Against this background, the question arises of how instructional material can be designed in a way that helps people acquire knowledge about abstract financial concepts. Multimedia learning theories suggest complementing verbal information with visuals that represent the respective topic or concept. Since abstract financial concepts lack palpable, concrete forms, these representational visuals are not simply available but have to be developed. Based on grounded cognition theory, this article discusses three approaches, ‘situations’, ‘emotions’ and ‘metaphors’, which might be used to generate representational visuals of abstract financial concepts. This study aims to provide ideas and enhance our understanding of how grounded cognition theory can be utilized as a guideline to create representational visuals of abstract financial concepts and thus multimedia learning material, which in turn may support increasing people's financial literacy. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Deep or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been adapted as reactive agents to quickly learn and respond with new investment strategies for portfolio management under the highly turbulent financial market environments in recent years. In many cases, due to the very complex correlations among various financial sectors, and the fluctuating trends in different financial markets, a deep or reinforcement learning based agent can be biased in maximising the total returns of the newly formulated investment portfolio while neglecting its potential risks under the turmoil of various market conditions in the global or regional sectors. Accordingly, a multi-agent and self-adaptive framework namely the MASA is proposed in which a sophisticated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) approach is adopted through two cooperating and reactive agents to carefully and dynamically balance the trade-off between the overall portfolio returns and their potential risks. Besides, a very flexible and proactive agent as the market observer is integrated into the MASA framework to provide some additional information on the estimated market trends as valuable feedbacks for multi-agent RL approach to quickly adapt to the ever-changing market conditions. The obtained empirical results clearly reveal the potential strengths of our proposed MASA framework based on the multi-agent RL approach against many well-known RL-based approaches on the challenging data sets of the CSI 300, Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 indexes over the past 10 years. More importantly, our proposed MASA framework shed lights on many possible directions for future investigation. © 2024 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.},

	abstract = {Selecting outstanding technology stocks for investment is challenging. Specifically, the research of the investment for academic purposes is not mature enough due to the disarray of the publications and the overwhelming informative experience from profit-making websites. Often, some authors entitle the stock price prediction as a stock selection problem; both prediction and selection are just sub-sections of portfolio management. Moreover, stock websites provide numerous potential criteria showing various evaluations to simulate and monitor the stock market professionally, which increases the difficulty of academic studies on stock selection. The paper generalizes a novel framework with a user-interactive interface for stock selection problems based on multi-source data fusion and decision-level fusion to enhance reliability limited by the narrow criteria performance and the strength of a model overcoming the weakness of a single-performed model. This framework benefits the time-series prediction and decision-making study. Besides, we propose adopting dynamic time warping to assist a task-learning process by customizing a loss function that improves the accuracy of data prediction. The experiment shows that the proposed method reduces the prediction log error by 6.3% on average and decreases the warping cost by 5.6% on average over all cases of real-situation data. Finally, we illustrate the proposed framework by implementing it in a real-world stock data selection. The results are practical and effective, further justified through a detailed ablation study.

	abstract = {Venture capital investments play a powerful role in fueling the emergence and growth of early-stage startups. However, only a small fraction of venture-backed startups can survive and exit successfully. Prior data-driven prediction based or recommendation based solutions are incapable of providing effective and actionable strategies on proper investment timing and amounts for startups across different investment rounds. In this paper, we develop a novel reinforcement learning-based method, AlphaVC, to facilitate venture capitalists' decision-making. Our policy-based reinforcement learning agents can dynamically identify the best candidates and sequentially place the optimal investment amounts at proper rounds to maximize financial returns for a given portfolio. We retrieve company demographics and investment activity data from Crunchbase. Our methodology demonstrates its efficacy and superiority in both ranking and portfolio-based performance metrics in comparison with various state-of-the-art baseline methods. Through sensitivity and ablation analyses, our research highlights the significance of factoring in the distal outcome and acknowledging the learning effect when making decisions at different time points. Additionally, we observe that AlphaVC concentrates on a select number of high-potential companies, but distributes investments evenly across various stages of the investment process. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

The variability of the instantaneous macro environment brings great difficulties to quantitative investment, so the extended factor model must learn how to self-adapt to extract the macro pattern from the massive stock volume and price information, and how to continuously map the extracted macro pattern to the stock investment is also an open question. To this end, we propose the first continuous regime-based dynamic factor model, RSAP-DFM, which adaptively extracts continuous macroeconomic information and completes the dynamic explicit mapping of stock returns for the first time through dual regime shifting, while the adversarial posterior factors effectively correct the mapping deviation of prior factors. In addition, our model integrates an innovative two-stage optimization algorithm and normally distributed sampling, which further enhances the robustness of the model. Performance on three real stock datasets validates the validity of our model, which exceeds any previous methods available. © 2024 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization is an important financial task that has received widespread attention in the field of artificial intelligence. In this paper, a novel deep portfolio optimization (DPO) framework was proposed, combining deep learning and reinforcement learning with modern portfolio theory. DPO not only has the advantages of machine learning methods in investment decision-making, but also retains the essence of modern portfolio theory in portfolio optimization. Additionaly, it was crucial to simultaneously consider the time series and complex asset correlations of financial market information. Therefore, in order to improve DPO performance, features of assets information were extracted and fused. In addition, a novel risk-cost reward function was proposed, which realized optimal portfolio decision-making considering transaction cost and risk factors through reinforcement learning. Our results showed the superiority and generalization of the DPO framework for portfolio optimization tasks. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets validated that DPO achieved the highest accumulative portfolio value compared to other strategies, demonstrating strong profitability. Its Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown also performed excellently, indicating good economic benefits and achieving a trade-off between portfolio returns and risk. Additionally, the extraction and fusion of financial information features can significantly improve the applicability and effectiveness of DPO. © 2024 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.},

These opinions would be based on posts from the X platform and the fundamentals of stocks listed in the S&P 500 index. Expert views are integral to active portfolio management, as proposed by Black–Litterman. The method we propose addresses the original subjectivity of the opinions by incorporating innovation and accuracy to generate views using analytical techniques. We utilize daily data from 2010 to 2022 for stocks from the S&P 500 and daily posts from Twitter API v2, collected under a research account license spanning the same period. We found that incorporating sentiment factors with machine learning techniques into the view generation process of the Black–Litterman model improves optimal portfolio allocation. Empirically, our results notably outperform the S&P 500 market when considering the annualized alpha. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Inspired by sparse learning, the Markowitz mean-variance model with a sparse regularization term is popularly used in sparse portfolio optimization. However, in penalty-based portfolio optimization algorithms, the cardinality level of the resultant portfolio relies on the choice of the regularization parameter. This brief formulates the mean-variance model as a cardinality (ℓ0 -norm) constrained nonconvex optimization problem, in which we can explicitly specify the number of assets in the portfolio. We then use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) concept to develop an algorithm to solve the constrained nonconvex problem. Unlike some existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm can explicitly control the portfolio cardinality. In addition, the dynamic behavior of the proposed algorithm is derived. Numerical results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several state-of-the-art algorithms.  © 2012 IEEE.},

In unison, they facilitate the management, storage, transmission, and analysis of vast data volumes. A significant portion of these challenges are articulated as optimization problems. The potency of AI and Data Science is deeply rooted in the successful resolution of these optimization problems, which are prevalent in areas such as machine learning model fine-tuning, operational research, and logistics. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that solutions to these optimization problems do not always come with guarantees. This does not necessarily imply that research is lacking in this direction. Instead, it is often a manifestation of the constraints imposed by the nature of the digital hardware used for calculations. Digital hardware is bound by physical limitations, including constraints on processing power, storage capacity, and time. A key limitation, however, is its inherent binary nature, which can handle only discrete values precisely and may struggle with mathematical functions on real variables.

Neoclassicals emphasize efficient markets and risk-averse, diversified portfolios. Behavioral finance highlights psychological biases influencing investment decisions but overlooks the role of reflection and external economic factors. On the other hand, the Austrian perspective views markets as dynamic processes driven by rational human actions, where individuals learn and adapt. Austrians critique neoclassical reliance on historical data and the behavioral perspective’s overemphasis on biases, advocating for a subjective approach to asset valuation and portfolio design. The article argues for an Austrian investment theory, emphasizing purposeful actions, learning, and individual judgment under uncertainty, contrasting with the static neoclassical and behavioral finance models.

This study focuses on advancing quantum machine learning algorithms for optimal financial portfolio management, presenting a novel approach implemented in Python that outperforms existing methods. The algorithm's capability to generate such substantial returns over time positions it as a groundbreaking tool for portfolio optimization in the dynamic landscape of financial markets. In the pursuit of enhancing quantum machine learning algorithms, this research focuses on the development and optimization of the QSVM algorithm. Leveraging Python for implementation, the study considers critical factors such as quantum circuit optimization, noise mitigation, and the integration of classical and quantum components to achieve superior results. The achieved portfolio performance over time not only underscores the algorithm's efficacy but also signifies a quantum advantage in financial decision-making. The implementation in Python ensures accessibility and applicability, facilitating the integration of this advanced quantum algorithm into existing financial frameworks. This research contributes to the evolving field of quantum finance, showcasing the potential of quantum machine learning in optimizing financial portfolios. The findings not only validate the superior performance of the proposed QSVM but also highlight the broader implications for the future of financial decision support systems, where quantum algorithms could play a transformative role in enhancing portfolio management strategies. The proposed Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) demonstrates unparalleled success, with a remarkable Portfolio performance over time of 89.65%.

	abstract = {We explore the statistical and economic importance of restrictions on the dynamics of risk compensation from the perspective of a real-time Bayesian learner who predicts bond excess returns using dynamic term structure models (DTSMs). The question on whether potential statistical predictability offered by such models can generate economically significant portfolio benefits out-of-sample is revisited while imposing restrictions on their risk premia parameters. To address this question, we propose a methodological framework that successfully handles sequential model search and parameter estimation over the restriction space in real time, allowing investors to revise their beliefs when new information arrives, thus informing their asset allocation and maximizing their expected utility. Empirical results reinforce the argument of sparsity in the market price of risk specification since we find strong evidence of out-of-sample predictability only for those models that allow for level risk to be priced and, additionally, only one or two of these risk premia parameters to be different than zero. Most importantly, such statistical evidence is turned into economically significant utility gains, across prediction horizons, different time periods and portfolio specifications. In addition to identifying successful DTSMs, the sequential version of the stochastic search variable selection scheme developed can be applied on its own and offer useful diagnostics monitoring key quantities over time. Connections with predictive regressions are also provided. Copyright: © 2023 INFORMS.},

However, it is deliberated as a challenging task to buy and sell because of its explosive and complex nature. The existing portfolio optimization models are primarily focused on just improving the returns whereas, the selection of optimal assets is least focused. Hence, the proposed research article focuses on the integration of stock prediction with the portfolio optimization model (SPPO). Initially, the stock prices for the next period are predicted using the hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model. Within this prediction model, the gated recurrent unit network (GRUN) model is utilized to simulate the interactions of the agent with the environment. The best actions in the prediction model are determined throughout the prediction process using the quantum differential evolution algorithm (Q-DEA). After the prediction of best assets, the optimal portfolio with the best assets is selected using the cumulative prospect theory (CPT) model. The work will be implemented in python and evaluated using the NIFTY-50 Stock Market Data (2000 -2021) dataset.

	abstract = {Our study develops a unique Security Risk Assessment based Smart Beta (SB) portfolio construction model for Robo Advising investors belonging to different risk categories. This model will cater to the Gen Z tech-savvy retail investors who have become more active and are interested in online investment platforms like Robo Advising. Our study differs from prior studies as it proposes a portfolio construction model for equity investors belonging to different risk categories while traditional approaches map debt portfolios to low risk investors and equity portfolios to high risk investors. Investors are generally risk-averse but prior studies have developed SB portfolios without considering their risk appetite. In this study, we assess the riskiness of stocks and then categorise them into different risk categories by mapping SB factors such as quality, value, alpha, momentum, etc. We further construct SB portfolios that minimise risk for each category of stocks to cater to investors belonging to low, moderate, high, as well as very high risk categories, using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Through a wide range of risk and return performance indicators, we provide evidence that our model offers higher returns at lower risk than human-managed portfolios. Our model proves to be more reliable and encourages Robo Advisors to offer SB portfolios catering to retail investors’ needs and their risk appetite. The study contributes to the evolving literature on Robo Advising, SB investing and to the debate on whether algorithms can replace human portfolio managers. © 2024, University of Wollongong.

Using 48 years of monthly indices of equity real estate investment trusts (EREITs), mortgage real estate investment trusts (MREITs), stocks, commodities, and bonds, we find that shocks to EREIT, and MREIT returns have a transitory impact on other assets. However, asset volatility connectedness among assets occurs at lower frequencies as markets slowly process pricing information. Therefore, shocks to EREIT and MREIT decay gradually and spill over to the other three assets for long periods. We also find that the intensity of the time-frequency connectedness of returns and volatility varies with business cycles and significant domestic and global non-recession events. We attribute the dominance of real estate investment trusts (REITs) in destabilising the financial system through long-term volatility transmission to the heavy linkage of REITs to highly illiquid underlying direct real estate markets and high REITs leverage, making them more sensitive to real estate fundamentals, monetary shocks and macroeconomic risks than stocks and bonds. The result of the algorithm-based (Formula presented.) machine learning model broadly supports the dominance of EREITs in the transmission of returns and volatility and shows that commodities have more explanatory power in the transmission of volatility than in returns. The empirical findings have implications for strategic and tactical asset allocation and policy design for market stability. © 2023 Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand.},

It adopts concepts and phenomena from the field of empirical and behavioral finance when little prior knowledge is obtained or strict statistical assumptions cannot be guaranteed.

To fill this gap, we propose a novel multitrend conditional value at risk (MT-CVaR), which embeds multiple trends and their influences in CVaR. Besides, we propose a novel PO model with this MT-CVaR as the risk metric and then design a solving algorithm based on the interior point method to compute the portfolio. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from diverse financial markets with different frequencies show that MT-CVaR achieves the state-of-the-art investing performance and risk management.  © 2012 IEEE.},

Core financial metrics, including Net Profit Margin (%), Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth Rate (%), and Book Value (BV) Growth Rate (%), are examined over a decade. The study investigates optimal cluster numbers through Silhouette analysis and the Elbow Curve method, harnessing the power of unsupervised Machine Learning (ML). Employing K-Means and hierarchical clustering with various linkage strategies (single, complete, average, centroid, and ward), the research unveils insightful clustering structures through dendrogram visualizations. This analysis involves 50 undervalued companies, scrutinizing their financial dynamics and clustering profiles. The ensuing impact of indicators on trading activities and returns over both short and long time horizons (365 days and 10 years, respectively) is meticulously dissected. In particular, this study contrasts trade counts, total returns, and average return per trade vis-à-vis a benchmark of Nifty50 companies. The research findings substantiate that a majority of the clusters yield higher returns compared to Nifty50 counterparts for identical technical indicator combinations. The application of advanced ML methodologies in this research provides actionable insights from complex financial data, catering to the needs of both researchers and practitioners. Ultimately, this work enriches financial analysis and offers valuable inputs for refining trading strategies. © 2024, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is a clear and urgent call to transform our food systems as a critical nexus to tackle ongoing global climate, biodiversity, equity, and nutrition crises. Many food and agricultural innovations are being developed and scaled but these innovations often target sector-specific problems and remain disconnected from the more complex demand for transformative change at scale. To bridge this demand for systemic change within the innovation ecosystem, initiatives are applying various approaches such as visioning, holistic assessments, innovation portfolio management and multistakeholder co-creation. Here we report on insights from applying a food systems tailored backcasting approach in a diversity of settings since 2021, including a national food system dialogue, a youth business innovation challenge, a landscape multi-stakeholder platform, a public-private sector co-learning session, an agroecological transitions program, and a hybrid food systems university course for graduate students and global professionals. We thereby build on existing literature and case studies of how change happens (or does not happen) and aim to use those insights to support food systems change makers. Across these settings, the backcasting approach asks participants to connect innovations with broader systems-change visions, to anticipate tradeoffs for multiple food system outcomes and population groups, and to cross sectoral boundaries. The use cases demonstrate that the backcasting process contributes to changes in views, practices and structures that participants work with. Specifically, it supports moving beyond “silver bullet” innovation approaches, the bundling of social and technical innovations, and building action-oriented cross-sectoral bridges. Food systems change is complex and innovations alone are insufficient to address its complexity. But innovations can play a positive role if connected to more holistic systems-change processes and goals. Considering strengths and limitations of the backcasting approach, the diversity of practical applications supports its potential to connect innovations to holistic food systems visions, to strengthen cross-sectoral collaboration and to bundle social and technical innovations for desirable food systems change.

However, existing studies treat news either as discrete trading signals or as continuous text features, leading to challenges such as human prior bias, difficulties in aligning different modalities, and neglecting the dynamic multi-dimensional logic relations among equities within news. Furthermore, there is a growing emphasis on multi-granularity information and deep reinforcement learning for their contributions to precise market estimation and alignment with investor objectives. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce NGDRL, a dynamic News Graph-based Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for portfolio optimization. Specifically, we identify three key dimensions of the latent logical structure and construct corresponding dynamic contextual relation graphs, serving as representatives to capture the core of the inter-equity relations. And we introduce a novel multi-granularity information integration structure to harness multi-granularity information. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from the United States and China show the superiority of our proposed framework over current state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its effectiveness for practical applications in portfolio optimization. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {Portfolio management is the art and science in fiance that concerns continuous reallocation of funds and assets across financial instruments to meet the desired returns to risk profile. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has gained increasing interest in portfolio management, where RL agents are trained base on financial data to optimize the asset reallocation process. Though there are prior efforts in trying to combine RL and portfolio management, previous works did not consider practical aspects such as transaction costs or short selling restrictions, limiting their applicability. To address these limitations, we propose a general RL framework for asset management that enables continuous asset weights, short selling and making decisions with relevant features. We compare the performance of three different RL algorithms: Policy Gradient with Actor-Critic (PGAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Evolution Strategies (ES) and demonstrate their advantages in a simulated environment with transaction costs. Our work aims to provide more options for utilizing RL frameworks in real-life asset management scenarios and can benefit further research in financial applications.  © 2024 ACM.},

	abstract = {The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the efficient market hypothesis (EHM), two essential aspects of theorising traditional financial theories, assume rationality in investors and the overall market. These challenge the assumptions of investors being rational and making informed decisions. Human sentiments, behaviour, and emotions have started conquering the study of financial markets. Several studies are already dedicated to learning the risk-return component of the financial market. But there has been less devotion towards understanding what makes equities investments to be considered inherently riskier than debts. The analysis here attempts to separate fundamental and speculative factors from the performance of the Indian market indices. The fundamental element mimics the pattern in the firms’ profits and how that affects investment returns. The impact of a change in the valuation of earnings on investment returns, or in other words, a movement in the P/E values, is shown in the speculative component. The optimism and pessimism level of investors is the cause of this. Statistical analysis of the market’s overall returns demonstrates a considerable prevalence of speculative elements.

Particularly, investors require robust algorithms that can navigate and make sense of extremely noisy and volatile markets. In this work, we use deep learning to select a portfolio of stocks and use a genetic algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters of DL. The work analyzes the improvement in using genetic-based hyperparameter optimization over grid searches. The Genetic Algorithm brings 40% improvements in prediction when compared to a random-grid search. Novelty-wise, the work couples a genetic-based hyperparameter optimization with multiple Deep RankNet models to predict the behavior of financial assets. Our results show promising portfolio returns 20% better than the general market. In the highly volatile COVID 19 period, the models exceed market returns by more than double. Overall, this paper brings a comprehensive work that integrates hyperparameter optimization, Deep RankNet, LSTM, period size variations, input variable transformation, feature selection, training/evaluation ratio analysis, and multiple portfolio selection strategies. © 2023},

This study aims to address this issue by introducing rational asset allocation strategies, improving efficiency, and increasing household income. Specifically, the study focuses on enhancing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, particularly the Deep Q-Network algorithm. The current network is optimized by employing a dual network structure, leading to improved performance. Moreover, the proposed model incorporates Grubbs' improved algorithm to effectively denoise stock data samples, enabling iterative training of diverse stock agents. The results demonstrate the following findings: (1) The application of the Grubbs' improved algorithm to the cumulative returns of different stocks significantly surpasses the results without noise reduction; (2) The Sharpe ratio of the stock agents using the Grubbs improvement algorithm is noticeably higher than that of the unimproved DRL algorithm. The Sharpe ratio of stock agents under the unimproved algorithm consistently remains below 1.0; (3) The maximum drawdown of the stock agents using the Grubbs' improved algorithm is significantly lower than that of the unimproved DRL algorithm. The unimproved algorithm exhibits relatively higher maximum drawdown rates. These findings indicate that Grubbs' improved algorithm possesses notable advantages in noise reduction and enhancing the cumulative returns of assets. © 2024 Institute of Information Science.

The multi-agent approach enables the examination of endogenous and exogenous shocks, business cycle impacts, and policy decisions on contributor behaviour. The model generates synthetic income trajectories to develop inclusive savings strategies for a broad population. Additionally, this research innovates by developing a multi-agent model capable of adapting to various environmental changes, contrasting with traditional econometric models that assume stationary employment and market dynamics. The non-stationary nature of the model allows for a more realistic representation of economic systems, enabling a better understanding of the complex interplay between agents and their responses to evolving economic conditions (A variation of this article was included as a chapter in the PhD Thesis of Ozhamaratli, F. submitted on 22 Jan 2024). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {In today's volatile and ever-changing financial markets, optimizing portfolio allocation is a formidable job. This study offers a novel strategy for optimizing a portfolio in volatile markets by drawing on techniques from the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). As a result of being slow to adapt to ever-changing market conditions, traditional investment strategies sometimes generate worse returns and expose their owners to more risk. In contrast, the RL-based method offers a dynamic and adaptable answer to this age-old problem. The proposed model uses RL to learn and improve its tactics over time in order to maximize returns while effectively limiting risk. Because RL is so malleable, the portfolio can instantly respond to fluctuations in the market, grabbing opportunities and avoiding setbacks. We conduct extensive tests using historical market data to evaluate our RL-based portfolio optimization approach and to compare it to conventional investment strategies. Our research proves that even in volatile markets, RL can produce superior risk-adjusted returns. We also shed light on the practical implementation of RL in portfolio management by providing insights into the key factors influencing its effectiveness. This research is an important first step in rethinking investment strategies for fluid markets. To improve investment outcomes and risk management, we give investors a robust framework for portfolio optimization that can survive and even thrive in volatile market environments. We accomplish this by making use of RL's tremendous potential. © 2024, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the realm of short-term portfolio optimization, the integration of machine learning with exponential growth rate techniques is gaining prominence. This paper introduces a novel approach for short-term portfolio optimization, termed Short-term Portfolio Optimization using Doubly Regularized EGR (SPODR), to address the challenges posed by limited data availability. SPODR utilizes radial basis functions for the effective identification of market trends, enabling improved stock market forecasts. The approach uniquely combines ℓ1 and ℓ2-regularization, adhering to empirical financial principles, to strike a balance between risk and return in short-term portfolios. A key aspect of SPODR is addressing the complexity of its ElasticNet-like objective, which poses a challenge for traditional methods due to its online learning nature. To overcome this, we have developed an algorithm based on the log barrier interior-point method. This algorithm is adept at efficiently optimizing portfolio allocation, taking into account the specific constraints inherent in our approach. Extensive comparative experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPODR significantly outperforms existing short-term portfolio optimization models. It achieves a right balance between return and risk. Furthermore, SPODR showcases efficient computational speed, enhancing its applicability in real-world financial settings.  © 2024 IEEE.},

The Solvency II directive requires insurance companies to calculate their SCR based on the complete loss distribution for the upcoming year. Since this task is, in general, computationally challenging for insurance companies (and therefore, not taken into account during portfolio optimization), employing more feasible proxy models provides a potential solution to this computational difficulty. Here, we present an approach that is also suitable for future applications in quantum computing. We analyze the approximability of the solvency capital ratio in a quadratic form using machine learning techniques. This allows for an easier consideration of the SCR in the classical mean-variance analysis. In addition, it allows the problem to be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), which benefits from the potential speedup of quantum computing. We provide a detailed description of our model and the translation into a QUBO. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of our approach through experimental studies. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of personal finance, the advent of Robo-Advisors has marked a significant leap towards democratizing investment management through the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This paper delves into the transformative role of AI in personal finance, focusing on how Robo-Advisors are reshaping investment strategies, risk assessment, and portfolio management. Through a comprehensive analysis, we examine the underlying algorithms that enable Robo-Advisors to provide personalized financial advice and manage assets with minimal human intervention. Our investigation includes a review of current literature to highlight advancements in AI technologies and their application in financial decision-making processes. Additionally, we propose a novel framework that enhances the capabilities of Robo-Advisors by incorporating advanced machine learning techniques and predictive analytics. The implementation of this framework is detailed, showcasing its potential to offer more accurate and tailored investment solutions. Empirical results obtained from real-world financial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving investment outcomes. By analyzing the performance of AI-driven Robo-Advisors against traditional human advisors, this study contributes valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of integrating AI into personal finance. Our findings underscore the potential for AI to revolutionize investment management, making it more accessible, efficient, and aligned with individual financial goals.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep or reinforcement learning approaches have been applied to optimise investment portfolios through learning the spatial and temporal information under the dynamic financial market. Yet in most cases, the existing approaches may produce biased trading signals based on the conventional price data due to a lot of market noises, which possibly fails to balance the investment returns and risks. Accordingly, a multi-agent and self-adaptive portfolio optimisation framework integrated with attention mechanisms and time series, namely the MASAAT, is proposed in this work in which multiple trading agents are created to observe and analyse the price series and directional change data that recognises the significant changes of asset prices at different levels of granularity for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of price series. Afterwards, by reconstructing the tokens of financial data in a sequence, the attention-based cross-sectional analysis module and temporal analysis module of each agent can effectively capture the correlations between assets and the dependencies between time points. Besides, a portfolio generator is integrated into the proposed framework to fuse the spatial-temporal information and then summarise the portfolios suggested by all trading agents to produce a newly ensemble portfolio for reducing biased trading actions and balancing the overall returns and risks. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the MASAAT framework achieves impressive enhancement when compared with many well-known portfolio optimsation approaches on three challenging data sets of DJIA, S&P 500 and CSI 300. More importantly, our proposal has potential strengths in many possible applications for future study. © 2024 IEEE.},

Employing an unsupervised topic modelling methodology from machine learning, we characterize the attention allocations of earnings conference call participants (corporate executives, financial analysts, and investors) over the topics discussed. We construct a novel topic similarity measure that captures incremental, difficult-to-observe, and time-varying firm relatedness. However, valuable information from topic peers is not incorporated into stock price in a timely fashion. A long-short strategy based on the returns of topic peers yields a monthly alpha of approximately 69 basis points. Furthermore, return predictability stems primarily from similar business models, customer management, and influential macroeconomic situations. Return predictability is more pronounced among focal firms with higher information complexities and arbitrage costs. Overall, this study provides a novel approach to automatically summarise firms' business aspects in focus and highlights the asset pricing implications of investors' underreactions to non-obvious and dynamic firm relatedness hidden in earnings conference calls. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Recent works have shown that this decoupled approach may be improved using an integrated framework that takes the downstream portfolio optimization into account during parameter estimation. In this work we implement an integrated, end-to-end, predict-&-optimize framework to the cardinality-constrained portfolio optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to implement the framework to a nonlinear mixed integer programming problem. Since the feasible region of the problem is discontinuous, we are unable to directly differentiate through it. Thus, we compare three different continuous relaxations of increasing tightness to the problem which are placed as an implicit layers in a neural network. The parameters of the factor model governing the problem's covariance matrix structure are learned using a loss function that directly corresponds to the decision quality made based on the factor model's predictions. Using real world financial data, our proposed end-to-end, decision based model is compared to two decoupled alternatives. Results show significant improvements over the traditional decoupled approaches across all cardinality sizes and model variations while highlighting the need of additional research into the interplay between experimental design, problem size and structure, and relaxation tightness in a combinatorial setting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, we consider the predictability of both short-term and long-term volatility directions using a range of machine learning techniques integrating a parsimonious Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) structure. An empirical analysis was undertaken using the S&P500’s realized volatility and the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s (CBOE) VIX implied volatility. We show that the machine learning techniques consistently enhance the accuracy of volatility directional forecasts.

In oil-importing nations like India, sectors such as banking, energy, materials, retailing, transportation, and manufacturing are adversely affected by price fluctuations, while industries like food, beverages, and pharmaceuticals tend to be more resilient. Conversely, oil-exporting countries experience milder effects, with the oil and gas sector bearing the brunt of supply disruptions while other industries remain insulated. Over time, the correlation between oil prices and stock market performance has strengthened, making oil price volatility a systemic risk factor. The source of oil price shocks, whether from demand changes or supply disruptions, significantly influences their impact on stock returns. Notably, there are substantial volatility spillovers between oil and stock markets.

	abstract = {“Asset pricing” in the context of financial economics pertains to the investigation and formulation of two fundamental pricing ideas and the models that go along with them. Various models exist for different scenarios, but they can be traced back to either general equilibrium asset pricing or rational asset pricing. Asset pricing models, as the name suggests, serve as valuable tools to assess the value of assets. The general equilibrium theory states that supply and demand interact to determine market prices. In this context, asset prices collectively satisfy the market clearing condition, which dictates that the supply and demand for each asset are equal at the prevailing price. Another crucial aspect of financial planning is portfolio management (PM), which aims to maximise investment profits while minimising losses. PM involves implementing effective asset allocation strategies to enhance returns and mitigate risks. Numerous studies have been conducted worldwide on various types of asset pricing models and investment portfolios, with some incorporating machine learning and deep learning techniques. In several models, the predictive accuracy has exceeded 90%. To shed light on the current research landscape in the realm of asset pricing and portfolio investment, we conducted a scientometric analysis. © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.},

We find that the predictability of returns decreases with longer forecasting horizons both in the U.S. and internationally. Despite this, we provide evidence that using firm-specific characteristics can remain profitable even after accounting for transaction costs, especially when we consider longer forecasting horizons. Studying the profitability of long-short portfolios, we highlight a trade-off between higher transaction costs connected to frequent rebalancing and greater returns on shorter horizons. Increasing the forecasting horizon while matching the rebalancing period increases risk-adjusted returns after transaction costs for the U.S. We combine predictions of expected returns at multiple horizons using double-sorting and a turnover reducing strategy, buy/hold spread. Double sorting on different horizons significantly increases profitability in the U.S. market, while buy/hold spread portfolios exhibit better risk-adjusted profitability. © 2024, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University.

	abstract = {Asset pricing via machine learning provides a promising way to capture price trends by fusing heterogeneous market factors to analyze their joint impact on stock movements rather than relying on statistical and econometric models in finance to explore the causality between a market indicator and stock returns. However, the fusion nature of machine learning also hides the way to unveil the internal mechanism of stock movements. In this study, a deep learning framework with visual clues is presented to unveil the entangled factors and their function on stock movements. In particular, a context-aware hierarchical attention mechanism (CHARM) is first proposed to encode unstructured textual media information to trace the literal power of news on such media-aware stock movements. The encoded media and other structured market factors are further fused via tensor-based learning to infer and visualize their interactions on stock fluctuations. Last, a pre-estimating method for locating turning points as trading clues is utilized to improve the efficiency of each investment opportunity. Experiments conducted in real securities markets demonstrate the proposed framework not only improve the readability of the investing strategies, but also enhance the predictive accuracy and the investing returns comparing with the state-of-the-art models, including AZFinText, TeSIA, eLSTM, CMT, MAC and SA-DLSTM. © 2023},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) assumes an increasingly pivotal role in the domain of financial asset management, endowing it with sophisticated capabilities in data analysis, modeling, prediction, and automation, thereby significantly augmenting the intricacies of asset management processes. The efficacy of AI is particularly evident in the realm of asset allocation strategies, notably within the Black-Litterman model where it furnishes an array of tools conducive to an enhanced understanding of investor sentiment. In this paper, the authors analyze recent studies that have focused on the application of artificial intelligence in financial portfolio management. Our main contribution is to clarify the added value that artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning, brings to optimizing portfolio management. This involves providing more accurate allocation strategies and predictions, all achieved with improved speed and efficiency. Emphasis is placed on the substantive contribution of artificial intelligence to the refinement of the Black-Litterman model, facilitating a more adept modeling of investor views through the application of diverse methodologies, such as technical analysis or text data analysis. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Therefore, we explore the efficacy of a hybrid quantum annealing (QA) search algorithm in improving portfolio optimization. This study pioneers the application of the trend ratio (TR) to a quantum annealing computer, converting it into a constrained quadratic model with a flexible presentation. The TR serves as a promising indicator in portfolio evaluation, considering the great balance between expected returns and risks. Utilizing D- Wave's hybrid solver, we present a thorough analysis and discussion of the proposed model realized in the QA structure. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can discover solutions of comparable quality in a significantly shorter amount of time than an exhaustive search. When extending the search space to sizes challenging for exhaustive search, we conducted experiments comparing our approach with state-of-the-art quantum-inspired artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. The results show that our method not only constructs higher-quality solutions but also requires the least computation time.

We evaluate our method using data from the Chinese futures market, which presents unique challenges due to factors such as short-selling and leverage. We compare RS-DSAC with benchmark strategies, including Buy & Hold, Constant Rebalance, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC), in terms of cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and maximum drawdown.

By polluting the information landscape, fake news interferes with agents' perception of the dividend process of the risky asset. Our analysis reveals that fake news decreases the steady-state price of the risky asset by making it even more risky. Moreover, fake news increases the market share of agents who use the destabilizing technical trading rule by rendering fundamental trading more difficult and costly. Instead of converging toward its steady state, the risky asset's price may thus be subject to wild fluctuations. As it turns out, these fluctuations are concentrated below the risky asset's steady-state price. We also show that fake news campaigns may allow certain agents to realize fraudulent profits.  © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2024.},

This paper proposes the application of the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) model, a reinforcement learning technique ideally suited for the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. Our research aims to optimize asset allocation within a diverse portfolio, including both high-volatility cryptocurrencies and the more stable US Dollar. The proposed A2C model strategically leverages current and predicted price data of cryptocurrencies with current asset allocation to make new asset allocation decisions. Our experiments demonstrate the A2C model's efficacy in managing asset allocations under varying market conditions. We particularly focus on how the model responds to alterations in the loss penalty factor within its reward function, which enables a shift between aggressive and conservative investment strategies. The model effectively balances risk and return, showing promising potential in achieving stable asset growth in rising markets while mitigating losses during market downturns.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the current global high inflation scenario, we aim to discover a dynamic multi-period allocation strategy to optimally outperform a passive benchmark while adhering to a bounded leverage limit. We formulate an optimal control problem to outperform a benchmark portfolio throughout the investment horizon. To obtain strategies under the bounded leverage constraint among other realistic constraints, we propose a novel leverage-feasible neural network (LFNN) to represent the control, which converts the original constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained optimization problem that is computationally feasible with gradient descent, without dynamic programming. We establish mathematically that the LFNN approximation can yield a solution that is arbitrarily close to the solution of the original optimal control problem with bounded leverage. We further validate the performance of the LFNN empirically by deriving a closed-form solution under jump-diffusion asset price models and show that a shallow LFNN model achieves comparable results on synthetic data. In the case study, we apply the LFNN approach to a four-asset investment scenario with bootstrap-resampled asset returns from the filtered high inflation regimes. The LFNN strategy is shown to consistently outperform the passive benchmark strategy by about 200 bps (median annualized return), with a greater than 90% probability of outperforming the benchmark at the end of the investment horizon. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {In finance, assuming more risk often corresponds to the expectation of higher, compensating returns. In this setting, alpha stands out as one of the most prevalent and refined measures of risk-adjusted return ever postulated, allowing for the estimation of the excess return that cannot be explained by the risk factors impacting an asset. This article introduces a neural network architecture designed to formulate an investment strategy with the explicit goal of maximizing alpha. The strategy, centered around market timing, determines on a daily basis, based on past returns of the risky asset, whether to fully invest in the risky asset or opt for the risk-free alternative. The neural network architecture comprises two components: a policy network for strategy implementation and an evaluation network for long-term alpha computation during parameter optimization. Employing value-weighted US size decile portfolios as risky assets, the study achieves significant out-of-sample alphas ranging from 3.6% to 8.2% per year under the <italic>q</italic>5 asset pricing model (with a transaction cost assumption of one basis point). By construction, these alphas are not generated by risky asset growth. Robustness tests yield similar results with equal-weighted decile portfolios or under the Fama and French six-factor asset pricing model. Variations in transaction cost, number of past returns used as inputs, policy network design, or training sample size produce similar outcomes. This study underscores the effectiveness of reinforcement learning-inspired techniques in uncovering alpha in financial markets. Authors},

These innovation portfolio management benefits are equally relevant for the public non-profit R&D sector, where innovation performance and outcomes are for societal impact. Public non-profit R&D can and should manage their innovation portfolios more intentionally, and can learn from private sector successes and challenges.

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) algorithms pose significant challenges in predicting unknown parameters for optimization models in decision-making scenarios. Conventionally, prediction models are optimized independently in decision-making processes, whereas ML algorithms primarily focus on minimizing prediction errors, neglecting the role of decision-making in downstream optimization tasks. The pursuit of high prediction accuracy may not always align with the goal of reducing decision errors. The idea of reducing decision errors has been proposed to address this limitation. This paper introduces an optimization process that integrates predictive regression models within a mean–variance optimization setting. This innovative technique introduces a general loss function to capture decision errors. Consequently, the predictive model not only focuses on forecasting unknown optimization parameters but also emphasizes the predicted values that minimize decision errors. This approach prioritizes decision accuracy over the potential accuracy of unknown parameter prediction. In contrast to traditional ML approaches that minimize standard loss functions such as mean squared error, our proposed model seeks to minimize the objective value derived directly from the decision-making problem. Furthermore, this strategy is validated by developing an optimization-based regression tree model for predicting stock returns and reducing decision errors. Empirical evaluations of our framework reveal its superiority over conventional regression tree methods, demonstrating enhanced decision quality. The computational experiments are conducted on a stock market dataset to compare the effectiveness of the proposed framework with the conventional regression tree-based approach. Remarkably, the results confirm the strengths inherent in this holistic approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to propose an improved version of portfolio optimization model through the prediction of the future behavior of stock returns using a combined wavelet-based long short-term memory (LSTM). Design/methodology/approach: First, data are gathered and divided into two parts, namely, “past data” and “real data.” In the second stage, the wavelet transform is proposed to decompose the stock closing price time series into a set of coefficients. The derived coefficients are taken as an input to the LSTM model to predict the stock closing price time series and the “future data” is created. In the third stage, the mean-variance portfolio optimization problem (MVPOP) has iteratively been run using the “past,” “future” and “real” data sets. The epsilon-constraint method is adapted to generate the Pareto front for all three runes of MVPOP. Findings: The real daily stock closing price time series of six stocks from the FTSE 100 between January 1, 2000, and December 30, 2020, is used to check the applicability and efficacy of the proposed approach. The comparisons of “future,” “past” and “real” Pareto fronts showed that the “future” Pareto front is closer to the “real” Pareto front. This demonstrates the efficacy and applicability of proposed approach. Originality/value: Most of the classic Markowitz-based portfolio optimization models used past information to estimate the associated parameters of the stocks. This study revealed that the prediction of the future behavior of stock returns using a combined wavelet-based LSTM improved the performance of the portfolio. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The asset allocation strategy based on our index can generate large economic gains for the mean-variance investors, with annualized CER (certain equivalent return) gains ranging from 10.91% to 7.80% as the investor’s risk appetite varies. The driving force of the predictive power appears to stem from the liquidity provider role that informed traders play, which decreases the market’s illiquidity risk and lowers the risk premium of equity.

	abstract = {Due to the complexity and dynamic nature of financial markets, portfolio management tasks require continuous adaptation with market intelligence. Furthermore, to make profitable trading decisions, it is essential to predict the future performance of the market. To that end, this study proposes a dynamic portfolio trading system in two stages: stock trend prediction and portfolio optimization. In the first stage, although many researchers proposed powerful classification models to predict BUY/SELL trading signals, some scholars only focused on converting time series' features into multichannel images without considering any spatial relationships between features. Considering the relational capacity of graphs, this study proposes a novel image-based classification model, called Pixel Graph Network (PGN), to analyze the constructed images with propagating information from all neighboring pixels, build up a representation of the images as special graphs, and get advantages of a graph-based learning algorithm. In the second stage, stocks with predicted BUY trading signals in the following days, are fed into the Mean–Conditional Drawdown at Risk (M-CDaR) optimization model to prevent any significant drawdown of the investment portfolio. Moreover, a hierarchical feature selection algorithm has been proposed, combined with a continuous trend labeling method to improve the efficiency of the training process. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed PGN model in comparison with benchmarks, 18 stocks from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are used for numerical experiments. The obtained results show the improvement and effectiveness of the proposed model in both stock trend prediction and portfolio optimization. In terms of financial performance, the proposed PGN+M-CDaR portfolio-based trading system achieves an average annual return of 112%, an average annual Sortino ratio of 10.78, and an average annual Sharpe ratio of 2.79 which are promising to achieve substantial profits while mitigating downside risk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

We use the cross-section of stock returns over a 52-year sample to analyze trading performance by implementing the machine learning algorithm of hierarchical clustering. We find that higher out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns are achieved relative to the traditional Markowitz portfolio through hierarchical clustering using a 3-month buy-and-hold, long-only strategy. Additionally, the average change in portfolio weights at each rebalancing period is significantly lower for the portfolio formed using machine learning relative to Markowitz, decreasing investor trading costs. The results are robust to various settings and subsamples. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {As digital transformation reshapes business practices across numerous industries, a growing need exists to systematically characterize the intrinsic value of digital products and services (DPS). Value comparisons are central to prioritizing project backlogs for groups constrained by budget, headcount, or time. Rationalizing ongoing work also requires assessments of project value to support the decision to discontinue efforts, including those associated with long-duration R&D. A survey of recent literature reveals several proposed DPS value frameworks to address this business need. However, no unified set of value elements collectively defines the utility of individual DPS activities. This paper addresses whether a coherent framework can be derived from multiple disparate DPS value models within the publication record. The problem space is evaluated through a multi-disciplinary lens, using concepts from systems engineering, computer science, and project and portfolio management. Results from optimizing a design structure matrix (DSM), contextual clustering using a natural language processing (NLP) model, and evaluating a hybrid DSM with NLP-derived similarities all reveal the potential for a hierarchical value framework. Each level defines a different granularity of value decomposition. Firms may identify the framework complexity that best suits the needs of their organizations, enabling management to balance DPS portfolios and resources more optimally. Furthermore, the approach allows for flexible updates as additional publications come to light, shifting the focus away from a rigid framework and toward an evergreen perspective on work item valuation.  © 2023 The Authors.},

We propose to apply linearized augmented Lagrangian method (LALM) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the optimization model in a higher efficiency, meanwhile theoretically guarantee their convergence and deduce closed-form solutions of their subproblems in each iteration.

Time-series financial forecasting is a crucial component in risk management and portfolio optimization. Finding a suitable technique for financial engineering poses a challenge since it must meet the criteria of being transparent, robust, and compatible. There is more and more multi-modal data being used in research, and prediction algorithms are getting harder to understand and making it harder for data to move smoothly. Candlestick methods are expected to be effective in the scenarios above. The utilization of this tool is prevalent within financial markets due to its accessibility, comprehensibility, and acceptance within the technical analysis community. This study examines the initial and subsequent stages of forecasting. The process of sequential pattern mining involves the extraction of candlestick patterns from candlestick data with several dimensions. Correlation analysis then assesses the connection between these patterns and potential future trends. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel approach to identifying commonalities in candlestick charts that exhibit considerable differences. Two experimental groups were utilized to evaluate the technique's efficacy, employing a sample size of 800 equities from the Chinese stock market.

The approaches that experts have taken to address this problem have ranged from intuition-based decisions to sophisticated optimization frameworks. In this paper, we introduce a novel portfolio optimization methodology for investors with a medium- to long-term horizon focusing on public markets via index funds. Our method marries a Markowitz-inspired framework with a Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint, and employs synthetic data generated through a Modified Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) approach that incorporates contextual information, specifically, the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The synthetic data generation algorithm captures the essential structure of the training dataset, while the CVaR-based optimization leads to portfolios with very good out-of-sample performance. This study emphasizes the merits of integrating contextual information and demonstrates the generative networks superiority over traditional approaches based solely on historical data. This innovative approach lays the groundwork for further advancements in asset allocation strategies fueled by synthetic data generating processes. © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization concerns with periodically allocating the limited funds to invest in a variety of potential assets in order to satisfy investors’ appetites for risk and return goals. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown its promising capabilities in sequential decision making problems. However, traditional DRL algorithms directly operate in the space of low-level actions, which exhibits poor scalability and becomes intractable in real-world problem instances when the dimensionality of the environment increases. To deal with this, in this work, a novel DRL hyper-heuristic framework is proposed for multi-period portfolio optimization problem. Instead of exploiting the entire action domain, our proposed approach is more effective by searching for low-level well-developed trading strategies. In addition, our proposed approach is data-driven and respects the nature of the problem by taking advantage of expert domain knowledge and posing it multidimensional states to further leverage additional diverse information from alternative views of the environment. The proposed approach is evaluated on five real-world capital market problem instances and numerous experimental results demonstrate our proposed method can achieve notable performance gains compared to state-of-art trading strategies as well as traditional DRL baseline method. The data we used are from five stock indices, covering the period from the 2012 to 2022. Our study can have salient policy implications for investment strategy formulation and effective regulatory frameworks establishment. © 2023 The Author(s)},

By comparing computational efficiency and data scalability, we evaluate the performance and applicability of these two methods and investigate their performance differences under various conditions. After a comprehensive assessment, it is concluded that the DTW+KNN method demonstrates advantages in terms of simplicity and computational efficiency, making it suitable for relatively small-scale data and relatively straightforward problems. On the other hand, the DTW+BILSTM method, in theory, offers more modeling capabilities, better capturing complex relationships within time series data, and is suitable for more diverse and complex data scenarios. The choice between these methods should be balanced based on specific task requirements, available data, and computational resources. When deciding which method to use, priority should be given to the DTW+KNN method. Subsequently, the decision to further consider using more complex methods like DTW+BILSTM should be based on performance and specific problem requirements.

As a direct consequence of this, the entire world is currently experiencing a catastrophic financial crisis. As a result of the pandemic, unemployment rates have increased across a number of different sectors, which is having a significant negative effect on international trade. During this challenging period, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is altering the way businesses examine the statistics pertaining to their cryptocurrency holdings. Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) in the realm of business can result in a variety of positive outcomes. The technological effects of AI make our day-To-day lives simpler because they eliminate the need for human intervention in many situations. It would be helpful to have a better understanding of artificial intelligence and the methods it uses, such as the classifier model, in the event that there was a pandemic. If people have access to real-Time data analysis and predictions that have been generated by AI and big data, they will be able to make better decisions. In anticipation of the arrival of a new world, the company, along with SMEs and start-ups, is stepping up its efforts to enhance the management of virtual businesses by establishing a presence on multiple e-Trade systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key player in the quest to find effective solutions to issues that arise in the workplace. AI is being applied to improve business operations in many different areas, including marketing, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, customer service, portfolio management, and product recommendations based on what customers want. These are just some of the many problems that are being solved by AI.

	abstract = {Venture capitalists invest not only in the business aspect of a deal but also in its contractual terms. Therefore, the selection of deals and the combination of contractual terms pose challenging decisions for them. This paper consists of two main sections. The first section introduces a novel framework for the valuation of venture capital (VC) deals, including startups and their contractual terms. By taking into account risk situations, this section presents the valuation of combined contractual terms, including call options, liquidity preference, and participant rights. In the second section, a new multiobjective mathematical model for VC deals and contractual terms portfolio selection is developed using right-tail probability, strategy alignment, and a utility function. To solve the proposed model, three metaheuristic algorithms - Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), Multi-Objective Binary Harmony Search Algorithm, and Dynamic Tuning Parameter Binary Harmony Search Algorithm (DTPBHS) - are applied. Based on numerical examples, DTPBHS outperforms other algorithms in the "Mean Ideal Distance"index, but NSGA-II demonstrates the best performance in the "Rate of Achievement of two objectives simultaneously"index. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed utility function is more robust than the right-tail probability function under default deals conditions. © 2024 Mohammadreza Valaei and Vahid Khodakarami.},

The authors leveraged existing literatures’ findings on factors and combined those major factor categories into the new model, which includes inflation, labor markets, financial condition, and proxy of global market, and the authors selected the optimal data series to optimize the effectiveness of detecting Fed decisions through a classification factor selection process. Also, the authors improved the regression from fixed coefficients to gradient boosting nonlinear regression approach to reflect the dynamic interconnections among all the factors and their lags through different periods. Upon conducting out-of-sample forecasting, with these selected factors and machine learning gradient boosting regression, the out-of-sample RMSE improved by 77% from traditional Taylor rule model, which offered an alternative robust solution for forecasting the Federal fund rates that can be further applied to asset pricing and investing.

Recently, with the introduction of deep models in finance, there has been a shift in the trend of portfolio optimization toward data-driven models, departing from the traditional model-based approaches. However, deep portfolio models often encounter issues due to the non-stationary nature of data, giving unstable results. To address this issue, we advocate the utilization of graph neural networks to incorporate graphical knowledge and enhance model stability, thereby improving results in comparison with state-of-the-art recurrent architectures. Moreover, we conduct an analysis of the algorithmic risk-return trade-off for deep portfolio optimization models, offering insights into risk for fully data-driven models. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In financial engineering, portfolio optimization has been of consistent interest. Portfolio optimization is a process of modulating asset distributions to maximize expected returns and minimize risks. Despite numerous studies on shallow learning models, they have shown limited success in analyzing the complex nature of massive stock data, a task where recent deep learning models excel. However, the deterministic nature of conventional deep learning models impedes their consideration of portfolio risk due to an inherent lack of uncertainty quantification in their predictions. This paper proposes a novel portfolio weighting strategy, incorporating both risk and return considerations within a deep learning framework. We propose the Predictive Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (PredACGAN), a probabilistic deep learning model, to measure prediction uncertainty. The PredACGAN generator leverages latent vectors and historical stock prices to predict future returns. The model synthesizes predictive distributions from various latent vectors and past prices. The associated risk is produced via the entropy of these distributions, facilitating portfolio optimization through both return and risk considerations. The proposed algorithm removes high-risk assets from the investment universe at rebalancing moments, enabling PredACGAN to optimize portfolios considering both return and risk. We evaluated PredACGAN and the accompanying algorithm with S&P 500 stocks from 1990 to 2020, with portfolios rebalanced monthly based on PredACGAN predictions and risk measures. The PredACGAN portfolios yielded 9.123% annual returns and a 1.054 Sharpe ratio, outperforming a risk-agnostic portfolio yielding 1.024% annual returns and a 0.236 Sharpe ratio. The PredACGAN portfolio also exhibited lower maximum drawdowns, highlighting its effectiveness. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Particularly, the time-varying Euclidean distance measure was constructed by combining the first four moments (i.e. mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) of the return distributions of cryptocurrencies following the ℓ2-normalisation. It was found that major cryptocurrencies converged to the centroid during the 2018 market crash, but diverged before and after the crash. Their divergence could be due to the uncertainty arising from market news and regulatory events. In addition, Bitcoin cosine similarity measure was developed to provide further insights into the relationship between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This cosine similarity shows how each cryptocurrency moves relative to Bitcoin, which is not captured by the Euclidean distance. More importantly, it was demonstrated that the divergence of major cryptocurrencies from their centroids can improve Markowitz’s efficient frontier and provide more diversification benefits to investors and portfolio fund managers. Finally, a profitable trading strategy was provided based on the Euclidean distance. © The Author(s) 2023.},

The increasing development of high-frequency trading and the explosive growth of data volume increasingly require online portfolio strategies to have fast execution speed. However, almost all existing online portfolio strategies cannot satisfy both effective and full utilization of historical data and fast execution speed simultaneously. To this end, this work proposes the Adaptive Moment Estimation (AME) strategy. The proposed strategy makes effective and full utilization of historical data in an incremental way, which not only achieves improved robustness in performance but also keeps linear time complexity. Theoretical and experimental analysis are respectively established to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed AME strategy. For theoretical analysis, AME’s universality is proved, which illustrates that it can theoretically compete with the benchmark Best Constant Rebalanced Portfolio in hindsight. For experimental analysis, AME achieves good performance on different evaluation metrics, and it can sustain reasonable transaction costs. Thus, it is a robust and excellent strategy with promising practical application prospects. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Our study builds on weekly data for the historical constituents of the S&P500 over the period from January 1999 to March 2021 and builds on typical equity factors, additional firm fundamentals, and technical indicators. A variety of machine learning models are trained on the binary classification task to predict whether a specific stock outperforms or underperforms the cross-sectional median return over the subsequent week. We analyze weekly trading strategies that invest in stocks with the highest predicted outperformance probability. Our empirical results show substantial and significant outperformance of machine learning-based stock selection models compared to an equally weighted benchmark. Interestingly, we find more simplistic regularized logistic regression models to perform similarly well compared to more complex machine learning models. The results are robust when applied to the STOXX Europe 600 as alternative asset universe. © 2023 The Authors. Journal of Forecasting published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

While the oil and gas industry plays a more dominant role for the component of aggregate market volatility that is associated with discount rate fluctuations, consumer services are most informative over market volatility that is attributable to cash flow fluctuations. More importantly, we find that the predictive information captured by industries not only helps improve the volatility forecasts for the stock market, but can also be used to generate significant economic benefits for investors who use these volatility forecasts in their asset allocation strategies. © 2023},

The results show that the sorted portfolios formed by the predicted return rates can obtain significant excess returns in the Chinese market. Furthermore, our research shows that incorporating the ML factor into the CH4 and FF5 model can improve the pricing power significantly. It indicates that the ML factor can complement the traditional pricing models. We also find the performance of factor models depend on macroeconomy and market sentiment, that is, the better the macroeconomic and stock market performance, the stronger the pricing power of the factor models in the Chinese market. Additionally, we explore whether ML factor falls under short-term, median-term, and long-term momentum and reversal factors, and our analysis demonstrates that the ML factor is more effective than momentum and reversal factors. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {This study examines the impact of incorporating cryptocurrencies into global asset portfolios using ensemble approaches and a tracing strategy. We considered cryptocurrency ratios of 1%, 3%, and 5% for including cryptocurrencies. Benchmarking was performed using classical portfolio optimization strategies such as minimum variance portfolio (MVP), maximum diversification portfolio (MDP), equal risk contribution portfolio (ERCP), and hierarchical risk parity (HRP). The ensemble methods and tracing strategies we evaluated were the equally weighted portfolio (EWP), the linear combination portfolio (LCP), the return tracing portfolio (RTP), and the return volatility tracing portfolio (RVTP). EWP averages the weights of classical methods, while LCP combines the objective functions of three optimization methods. RTP and RVTP represent tracing strategy portfolios with monthly rebalancing, selecting the best-performing portfolio based on cumulative returns or a combination of cumulative returns and annualized volatility. Our findings reveal that increasing the cryptocurrency allocation improves performance metrics in ensemble portfolios but also leads to higher risk. In addition, including cryptocurrencies reduces transaction fees, especially evident in the LCP with a 5% allocation. In the case of a 3-month RTP, HRP emerged as the preferred strategy, outperforming the use of HRP alone. In the case of a 6-month RVTP, MVP remained the preferred choice, consistently achieving lower volatility.  © 2013 IEEE.},

If a switch in the behaviour of the markets is not quickly detected it can be a source of loss, since previous trading positions may be inappropriate in the new regime. However, if a regime-switch can be detected quickly, and especially if it can be predicted ahead of time, these changes in market behaviour can instead be a source of substantial profit. The work of this paper builds on two previous works by the authors, the first of these dealing with regime detection and the second, which is an extension of the first, with regime prediction. Specifically, this work uses our previous regime-prediction model (KMRF) within a framework of multi-period portfolio optimisation, achieved by model predictive control, (MPC), with the KMRF-derived return estimates accuracy-boosted by means of a novel use of a Kalman filter. The resulting proposed model, which we term the KMRF+MPC model, to reflect its constituent methodologies, is demonstrated to outperform industry-standard benchmarks, even though it is restricted, in order to be acceptable to the widest range of investors, to long-only positions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Nevertheless, existing imitation learning algorithms have limitations in effectively leveraging expert demonstrations when confronted with dynamic environments, as the behavior cloning loss weight cannot be adaptively updated. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Soft Imitation Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to guide the training of reinforcement learning agents in an adaptive manner. Additionally, we addressed the challenge of high-dimensional action spaces for reinforcement learning in portfolio management with value decomposition, and provide theoretical proof of convergence for this method. To validate the effectiveness of the SIRL algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments using stock market data from emerging (China) and developed (the US) countries. Our experiments indicate the versatility of the proposed SIRL across different types of trading data, encompassing both high-frequency (5-minute interval) and low-frequency (daily and weekly) data. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

The key benefit of this method is to control the risk contribution of each asset individually and reduce the unnecessary fluctuation in the allocation by not relying on the expected return of assets. The RB portfolio optimization requires one important parameter, a risk budget vector, and the portfolio performance is strongly influenced by the delicate choice of the values in this vector. Moreover, if the risk strategy allows deviation from a predefined risk budget, then it introduces the problem of finding the optimal time-dependent risk budget deviations. In this article, the author presents a reinforcement learning framework that can select this critical parameter optimally by learning how to control time-dynamic risk budgets in an automated and efficient manner. The experiment result shows that our agent can improve the target performance metric with statistical significance in the different asset universes, indicating that our agent can pick close to optimal risk budget deviations based on the learned policy. © 2023 With Intelligence LLC.},

Upon outlining the methodology to the finance literature, this paper offers three key contributions to the study of asset pricing. Firstly, the characteristic space is visualised to showcase non-monotonic relationships in multiple dimensions that were as yet unseen. Secondly, the means through which neural networks and random forest regressions fit stock returns is also visualised, showing where Machine Learning is contributing to understanding. Finally, an initial application of TDABM for the segmentation of the cross-section is posited, with significant abnormal returns identified.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how organizations manage and integrate exploration and exploitation across the innovation project portfolio. Such ambidextrous capabilities are required for organizations to innovate and succeed in today's rapidly changing competitive environment. Understanding how exploration and exploitation projects are integrated can illustrate ways to enhance ambidexterity and boost learning for the benefit of both approaches. Design/methodology/approach: A multiple-case study approach was used to explore innovation portfolio management in six large organizations that emphasize innovation in their strategies. Findings: The findings draw upon concepts of paradox and contingency to reveal that the inherent tension between formality and flexibility in managing innovation project portfolios is aligned with the need for organizational ambidexterity that maintains effective exploitative innovation while supporting explorative innovation capabilities. Four integration mechanisms are identified that enhance ambidexterity across the innovation portfolio by embedding processes for transition from exploration to exploitation and cross-fertilizing knowledge to build innovation capability across both exploration and exploitation. Practical implications: Managers may find inspiration on ways to enhance learning by bridging exploration and exploitation projects from the four types of integration mechanisms. Recognizing the paradoxical nature of the tension between formality and flexibility in project and portfolio management may also help guide organizations to effectively develop ambidextrous approaches to enhance overall innovation outcomes. Originality/value: In contrast to perspectives which suggest that paradox and contingency approaches represent disparate perspectives, the authors demonstrate how they can complement each other and work together through innovation portfolio management to support ambidexterity at the portfolio and project levels. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Financial products mostly consists in instruments used by households to prepare for retirement and/or to transfer wealth across generations. However, their usage remains low. Current technical solutions aimed at boosting financial products’ consumption mostly revolve around robo-advisors automating portfolio management tasks. Nonetheless, there is no tool to automate the distribution of those products, a gap this study aims to bridge. To do so, a private data-set from a French Fintech is leveraged. It describes at a macro level the structure of 1500+ households and their wealth. This information is fed to standard classification algorithms and regression techniques to predict whether or not households are likely to subscribe to a life insurance or a retirement plan or a real estate program over the forthcoming year and to forecast the associated level of investment. Calibrations show that households’ subscription behavior over the next 12 months towards core investments products can be predicted with a high level of performance (A.U.C>90%). The information was yet inappropriate to predict the level of investments on those products (R2<30-40%). Standard classification techniques could thus be used by financial advisors to accelerate client discovery on their existing portfolio. This should thereby result in productivity gains for those professionals and improve the distribution of financial products. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Our investigation is originally based on the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) framework, but considering the possible multicollinearity and nonlinearity, it is extended to various machine learning (ML) models and combination forecasting models. The results reveal that higher-order moments, including the two highest moments, always significantly improve predictive performance for the COVID-19 crisis. We further examine the interpretability of ML models and each factor's contribution to the prediction, finding that odd and even moments contain short- and long-term prediction information, respectively. This paper also highlights the effectiveness of ML models for capturing trends in oil futures volatility with higher-order moments and the satisfactory performance of combination forecasting models. Finally, we investigate the predictability of asymmetric risk patterns and obtain identical results.

	abstract = {Forecasting cryptocurrency volatility can help investors make better-informed investment decisions in order to minimize risks and maximize potential profits. Accurate forecasting of cryptocurrency price fluctuations is crucial for effective portfolio management and contributes to the stability of the financial system by identifying potential threats and developing risk management strategies. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive study of statistical and machine learning methods for predicting daily and weekly volatility of the following four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero. Several models and forecasting methods are compared in terms of their forecasting accuracy, i.e., HAR (heterogeneous autoregressive), ARFIMA (autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average), GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity), LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), RR (ridge regression), SVR (support vector regression), MLP (multilayer perceptron), FNM (fuzzy neighbourhood model), RF (random forest), and LSTM (long short-term memory). The realized variance calculated from intraday returns is used as the input variable for the models. In order to assess the predictive power of the models considered, the model confidence set (MCS) procedure is applied. Our experimental results demonstrate that there is no single best method for forecasting volatility of each cryptocurrency, and different models may perform better depending on the specific cryptocurrency, choice of the error metric and forecast horizon. For daily forecasts, the method that is always found in a set of best models is linear SVR, while for weekly forecasts, there are two such methods, namely FNM and RR. Furthermore, we show that simple linear models such as HAR and ridge regression, perform not worse than more complex models like LSTM and RF. The research provides a useful reference point for the development of more sophisticated models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Temporal branch uses temporal attention and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to extract temporal features of asset price series. Correlation branch uses graph convolutional layer to extract correlations among multiple assets. Finally, we utilize softmax to determine the portfolio weights in decision-making module.

Allocation constraints are used to enforce minimal or maximal investments into particular subsets of assets to control for objectives such as limiting the portfolio's exposure to a certain sector due to environmental concerns. Although methods for (CRL) can optimize policies while considering allocation constraints, it can be observed that these general methods yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to handle allocation constraints based on a decomposition of the constraint action space into a set of unconstrained allocation problems. In particular, we examine this approach for the case of two constraints. For example, an investor may wish to invest at least a certain percentage of the portfolio into green technologies while limiting the investment in the fossil energy sector. We show that the action space of the task is equivalent to the decomposed action space, and introduce a new (RL) approach CAOSD, which is built on top of the decomposition. The experimental evaluation on real-world Nasdaq data demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CRL benchmarks for portfolio optimization. © 2023 The Authors.},

In this hybrid model, share price index futures are decomposed to extract data characteristics at different time scales by the wavelet transform and the ARIMA-LSTM model are applied to predict the close price of futures. The findings of the study are as follows. 1) The DWT hybrid model and the MODWT hybrid model have higher forecasting accuracy than some commonly used forecasting models under the three metrics of MAE, MAPE and RMSE. The DWT-ARIMA-LSTM model has better forecasting performance when the forecasting performance in different markets and the operational efficiency of the method are combined. 2) The DWT method is more applicable than the MODWT method in forecasting models of futures closing price series; the approximate signals obtained from the DWT decomposition have lower volatility and can better characterise the original signals. 3) The LSTM model has better prediction performance for noisy residual series, while the ARIMA model has better prediction performance for less noisy approximate signals. 4) Based on the forecasting results, a timing trading strategy is constructed that can maintain a robust return performance under different market conditions, especially on the risk side with significant advantages. In addition, this work examines the impact of the unexpected event of the COVID-19 epidemic on the forecasting performance of the model, and the results show that the model can adapt to different data structures to achieve more robust forecasting performance.

This paper focuses on ESG-valued multi-period portfolio selection problem which incorporates ESG factor into traditional portfolio optimization. Using ESG-valued returns instead of traditional returns, we propose an ESG-valued fused LASSO model to promote an optimal sparse multi-period portfolio strategy. The objective of the model is to minimize a combination of returns and risks with respect to ESG ratings based on classical Markowitz mean–variance framework. The sparsity of the portfolio at each period and the turnover across periods is achieved by the ℓ1 regularization approach. To improve the out-of-sample performance of the ESG-valued model, we introduce two machine learning methods, namely random forest and support vector regression, to predict the ESG-valued returns. We develop a symmetric alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the regularized optimization model. Additionally, some other sparsity-driven penalty functions are discussed which results in a general framework of multi-period portfolio optimization. Finally, numerical experiments on several real datasets from both in-sample and out-of-sample demonstrate the positive effect of ESG in multi-period portfolio optimization. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Online portfolio selection (OPS) has received increasing attention from machine learning and quantitative finance communities. Despite their effectiveness, the pioneering OPS methods have several key limitations. First, price predictions are usually based on predetermined trends, which is inadequate for a fast-changing market patterns. Second, each asset is treated individually, ignoring the pervading relevance among the assets. Third, the risk terms are usually missing or inappropriate in optimizations. This paper proposes a novel OPS method, namely, the online low-dimension ensemble method, to overcome the limitations. Motivated by the stylized facts for the co-movements of assets, the financial market is regarded as a high-dimensional dynamical system (HDS), and a large number of low-dimensional subsystems (LDSs) are randomly generated from the HDS to extract the correlation information among the assets. The assets’ price predictions are first made using these LDSs and then aggregated to formulate the final prediction using ensemble learning techniques. Thanks to the particular merits brought by our predicting scheme, we also develop a novel high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation/prediction method for short-term data, efficiently assessing the instantaneous risk of the projected portfolios. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach obtains more accurate predictions as the correlation information is fully exploited. With the predictive instantaneous risk assessment, a more appropriate optimization problem is proposed, substantially improving the OPS setting and leading to significantly better investment performance. Therefore, this study develops a flexible and promising approach to learning fast-changing market patterns and demonstrates that the high-dimensional feature of the market is a crucial information source for financial modeling with short-term data rather than a barrier in the conventional sense. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to illustrate our method further. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that combines the ideas of deep learning and reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn and make decisions in complex environments. It has been applied to a wide range of tasks, including gaming, robotics, and finance, among others. In finance, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising technique for solving strategic decision-making problems in complex financial environments using reward-based approaches for optimal control. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that leverages the power of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) coupled with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to tackle the complex problem of portfolio optimization. What sets this approach apart is its utilization of MARL, which involves multiple agents learning and interacting within the same environment. This is in contrast to the traditional single-agent approaches commonly used in portfolio optimization. In portfolio optimization, MARL enables agents to learn from the interactions with other agents and the environment, leading to more realistic and robust investment strategies. The performance of the algorithm was assessed on the S&P 500 market using various numbers of agents and assets, and its performance was compared to several benchmarks. The performance metrics used for evaluation consisted of annual profit, annual volatility, Sharpe ratio, and Sortino ratio. The findings demonstrated that the algorithm outperformed the benchmarks in terms of all the performance metrics considered, regardless of the number of agents and assets involved. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.},

	abstract = {We propose a new approach to portfolio optimization that utilizes a unique combination of synthetic data generation and a CVaR-constraint. We formulate the portfolio optimization problem as an asset allocation problem in which each asset class is accessed through a passive (index) fund. The asset-class weights are determined by solving an optimization problem which includes a CVaR-constraint. The optimization is carried out by means of a Modified CTGAN algorithm which incorporates features (contextual information) and is used to generate synthetic return scenarios, which, in turn, are fed into the optimization engine. For contextual information, we rely on several points along the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The merits of this approach are demonstrated with an example based on 10 asset classes (covering stocks, bonds, and commodities) over a fourteen-and-half-year period (January 2008–June 2022). We also show that the synthetic generation process is able to capture well the key characteristics of the original data, and the optimization scheme results in portfolios that exhibit satisfactory out-of-sample performance. We also show that this approach outperforms the conventional equal-weights (1/N) asset allocation strategy and other optimization formulations based on historical data only. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {As deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years, there have been several cases applying DNNs to portfolio management (PM). Although some researchers have experimentally demonstrated its ability to make a profit, it is still insufficient to use in real situations because existing studies have failed to answer how risky investment decisions are. Furthermore, even though the objective of PM is to maximize returns within a risk tolerance, they overlook the predictive uncertainty of DNNs in the process of risk management. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called risk-sensitive multiagent network (RSMAN), which includes risk-sensitive agents (RSAs) and a risk adaptive portfolio generator (RAPG). Standard DNNs do not understand the risks of their decision, whereas RSA can take risk-sensitive decisions by estimating market uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. Acting as a trader, this agent is trained via reinforcement learning from dynamic trading simulations to estimate the distribution of reward and via unsupervised learning to assess parameter uncertainty without labeled data. We also present an RAPG that can generate a portfolio fitting the user's risk appetite without retraining by exploiting the estimated information from the RSAs. We tested our framework on the U.S. and Korean real financial markets to demonstrate the practicality of the RSMAN. © 2012 IEEE.},

This formulation in the ensemble learning field allows determining the ensemble's weights considering the error predictions of the base learners, the variability in their predictions, and the covariance among their predictions’ errors, which is completely aligned with the bias–variance–covariance theory. Under the framework proposed, four potential instantiations have also been provided. The first two ensemble models impose the non-negativity constraints on the ensemble's weights (along with the equality constraint that the ensemble's weights sum up to one) and are solved with the active set algorithm. The second two ensemble models do not include the non-negativity constraints on the ensemble's weights (which in the financial literature are called the non-shorting constraints), giving rise to a convex quadratic programming (QP) problem (as the matrix included in the quadratic term is symmetric and positive definite) that is solved by the Lagrangian procedure. Extensive experiments with regression datasets evaluate the proposed ensemble framework. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art ensemble methods confirm that the ensemble framework yields the best overall performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Furthermore, a mean-variance investor can realize sizable economic gains by using this spillover index in his/her asset allocation. The forecasting power of the spillover index remains significant after controlling for popular economic variables and newly proposed predictors. Due to the absence of learning, the spillover index shows increasing predictive ability over the recent period. The economic origins of the spillover index’s success stem from both the cash flow and discount rate channels, as well as significant association with investor sentiment and tail risk.

This paper proposes a portfolio selection framework based on machine learning and asset characteristics. Leveraging the inherent advantages of machine learning, the framework utilizes asset characteristics to directly predict portfolio weights, bypassing return distribution prediction in the conventional two-step portfolio management paradigm. The framework is applied to asset allocation research in the Chinese stock market. The research results show that: 1) The proposed investment strategies capture incremental information within high-dimensional characteristics and uncover both linear and non-linear relationships between asset characteristics and portfolio weights, resulting in a significant enhancement of investment performance. 2) Trading friction-related characteristics are the most important indicators for predicting portfolio weights. 3) These strategies yield higher returns on stocks with stricter arbitrage restrictions while exhibiting lower sensitivity to changes in macroeconomic conditions. Under other economic constraints, these strategies remain robust.

	abstract = {Large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs) are an essential research topic in the evolutionary computation (EC) community with two challenges: slow convergence in the huge search space and the trap in massive locally optimal solutions. To tackle these two challenges, this paper proposes a bi-directional learning particle swarm optimization (BLPSO) with two learning strategies, called diversity learning strategy (DLS) and convergence learning strategy (CLS). In DLS, we first propose a diversity evaluation mechanism based on locally sensitive hashing (LSH) to measure the diversity of individuals. Then the density individuals will learn from other dispersed individuals with good diversity to enhance the diversity of the population. In CLS, the inferior individuals will learn from other superior individuals with excellent evolution information to help the population accelerate convergence speed. These two learning strategies act in different roles and complement each other. With these two learning strategies, BLPSO achieves a balance between sufficient diversity and fast convergence in solving LSOPs. Two large-scale test suites, IEEE CEC2010 and IEEE CEC2013, are used to test the performance between BLPSO and other state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that BLPSO outperforms other algorithms on both test suites, including the winner algorithms of the IEEE CEC2010 and IEEE CEC2012 competitions. Finally, BLPSO is applied to a large-scale portfolio optimization problem to illustrate its application capability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {E-portfolios, or electronic portfolios, have recently gained popularity as a means for students and continuous learners to present their skills, accomplishments, and other relevant information in an online format. To confirm learning outcomes, e-portfolios need secure, dependable, and privacy-protecting systems for issuing and verifying credentials. When any client changes their document, designs present in help are altered, and it is imperative to refresh them in setup data handling frameworks. Considering the unchanging nature of the text, it is a mind-boggling undertaking to refresh the changed substance in web-related applications. Making computerized antiques is one of the significant issues to be evident and solid in updated content. Existing frameworks give private organizations comprehensive, concentrated arrangements that depend on trusted outsiders to issue and confirm accreditations. In addition, they need to give students the tools to take ownership of and share the material in their e-portfolios with other organizations, which increases the potential for forgery and bogus credentials. This paper proposes the Trusty URI Learning-Based Secure Blockchain Management Schema (TURILSBMS). This framework ensures the legitimacy and uprightness of client certifications. What is more, the information relates to an e-portfolio. While unquestionable cases are used for e-portfolio qualification evidence confirmation and check, decentralized IDs and undeniable certificates are used for client profile differentiating proof, verification, and approval. We have planned and carried out a model of the proposed plot utilizing a Quorum consortium blockchain network. Considering the assessments, our arrangement is attainable, secure, and protective. Compared to traditional approaches, the proposed approach gives better privacy-based immutable digital artifact creation over nanopublication. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The continuous combination of digital network technology and traditional financial services has given birth to digital financial networks, which explore massive economic data under the AI-driven models to achieve intelligent connections among financial institutions, markets, transactions, and instruments. Empirical asset pricing is a challenging task in financial analysis, which has attracted research attention. However, existing studies only focus on tackling the challenges of equity risk premium in the single stock market. Considering multiple economic linkages between the two countries, the transaction history of the US stock market as empirical knowledge is a powerful supplement to improve the prediction of equity risk premium in the China market. In this paper, we aim to fully leverage the prior information in two stock markets for empirical asset pricing models. Due to the rich financial domain knowledge, there may be various characteristic signals that partially overlap in different periods. To address these issues, we propose a framework based on long-short dual-mode knowledge distillation, termed as LSDM-KD, which incorporates US and China stock market models, and a shared characteristic signals model. The method effectively understands the relationships between assets and market behaviour, reducing reliance on expensive correlation databases and professional knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on US and China stock market datasets demonstrate that our LSDM-KD can significantly improve the performance of empirical asset pricing. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The goal of portfolio management is to simultaneously maximize the accumulated return and also to control risk. In consecutive trading periods, portfolio manager needs to continuously adjust the portfolio weights based on the factors which can cause price fluctuation in the market. In the stock market, the factors affecting the stock price can be divided into two categories. The first is price fluctuations caused by irrational investment of the speculators. The second is endogenous value changes caused by operations of the company. In recent years, with the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been increasingly employed by scholars to address financial problems, particularly in the area of portfolio management. However, the deep RL models proposed by these scholars in the past have focused more on analyzing the price changes caused by the investment behavior of speculators in response to technical indicators of actual stock prices. In this research, we introduce an RL-based framework called FinBPM, which takes both the factor pertaining to the impact on operations of the company and the factor of the irrational investment of the speculator into consideration. For our experimentation, we randomly selected 12 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Index to construct our portfolio. The experimental results reveal that, in comparison to conventional reinforcement learning methods, our approach with at least 13.26% increase over other methods compared. Additionally, it achieved the best Sharpe ratio of 2.77, effectively maximizing the return per unit of risk. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

	abstract = {Real estate is a favored investment option as it allows investors to diversify their portfolios and minimize risk. Investors can invest in real estate directly by purchasing a property, or through real estate investment funds (REITs) where they can purchase shares in companies that own and manage real estate. Investing in REITs has become increasingly popular because it eliminates some of the disadvantages associated with direct real estate investment, such as the need for a large upfront payment. When investing in mixed asset portfolios, it is crucial to predict future prices accurately to ensure profitable and less risky asset allocation. However, literature on price prediction often focuses on only one or two algorithms, and there is no research that explores REITs’ price prediction in the context of portfolio optimization. To address this gap, we conducted a thorough evaluation of 5 machine learning algorithms (ML), including Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), k-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Long/Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM), as well as other financial benchmarks like Holt's Exponential Smoothing (HES), Trigonometric Seasonality, Box–Cox Transformation, ARMA Errors, Trend, and Seasonal Components (TBATS), and Auto-Regression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We applied these algorithms to predict future prices for 30 REITs from the US, UK, and Australia, as well as 30 stocks and 30 bonds. The assets were then used as part of a portfolio, which we optimized using a genetic algorithm. Our results showed that using ML algorithms for price prediction provided at least three times the return over benchmark models and reduced risk by almost two-fold. For REITs, we observed that the use of ML algorithms led to a higher allocation to REITs diversified by country. In particular, our results showed that SVR was the best-performing algorithm in terms of risk-adjusted returns across different time horizons, as confirmed by our Friedman test results (Sharpe ratio). Overall, our study highlights the effectiveness of ML algorithms in predicting asset prices and optimizing portfolio allocation. © 2023 The Author(s)},

This study analyzes various model types and their financial forecast and management performance.

Deep learning models, particularly LSTM, outperform classical machine learning models in different financial contexts. LSTM has 93.8% accuracy, high precision, recall, and F1 score, showing superior predicting ability. Traditional machine learning models have moderate accuracy and poor performance measures, limiting their ability to capture complicated financial patterns. According to feature importance analysis, historical stock prices, firm financial data, and economic indicators improve prediction accuracy. Combining these attributes, Deep learning algorithms can better predict financial trends and enhance investment strategies. We also evaluate model types for stock price prediction, market trend research, credit risk assessment, and portfolio optimization. LSTM routinely outperforms alternative models in certain settings, helping firms make educated decisions. Deep learning models are feasible for real-time financial applications due to their high computational complexity and quick forecasts. Traditional models, however simpler, are inaccurate and slow.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that networks among firms (sectors) play a vital role in asset pricing. This paper investigates these implications and develops a novel end-to-end graph neural network model for asset pricing by combining and modifying two state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. First, we apply the graph attention mechanism to learn dynamic network structures of the equity market over time and then use a recurrent convolutional neural network to diffuse and propagate firms' information into the learned networks. This novel approach allows us to model the implications of networks along with the characteristics of the dynamic comovement of asset prices. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in both predicting returns and improving portfolio performance. Our approach demonstrates persistent performance in different sensitivity tests and simulated data. We also show that the dynamic network learned from our proposed model captures major market events over time. Our model is highly effective in recognizing the network structure in the market and predicting equity returns and provides valuable market information to regulators and investors. © 2023},

	abstract = {The analysis of financial reports is a crucial task for investors and regulators, especially the mandatory annual reports (10-K) required by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) that provide crucial information about a public company in the American stock market. Although SEC suggests a specific document format to standardize and simplify the analysis, in recent years, several companies have introduced their own format and organization of the contents, making human-based and automatic knowledge extraction inherently more difficult. In this research work, we investigate different Neural language models based on Transformer networks (Bidirectional recurrence-based, Autoregressive-based, and Autoencoders-based approaches) to automatically reconstruct an SEC-like format of the documents as a multi-class classification task with 18 classes at the sentence level. In particular, we propose a Bidirectional fine-tuning procedure to specialize pre-trained language models on this task. We propose and make the resulting novel transformer model, named SEC-former, publicly available to deal with this task. We evaluate SEC-former in three different scenarios: 1) in terms of topic detection performances; 2) in terms of document similarity (TF-IDF Bag-of-words and Doc2Vec) achieved with respect to original and trustable financial reports since this operation is leveraged for portfolio optimization tasks; and 3) testing the model in a real use-case scenario related to a public company that does not respect the SEC format but provides a human-supervised reference to reconstruct it.  © 2013 IEEE.},

In other words, they will have appropriate investment portfolios to diversify their investment plan, aiming to reduce risks and improve returns. Many models, from machine learning to deep learning, from traditional to modern methodologies, have been proposed and applied to the 'portfolio optimization' problem. This study uses several deep learning models, combining the attention mechanism to predict the investment portfolios with the highest Sharpe ratio over a certain period. Our research investigates whether long-Term investing (forecasting a portfolio over a month or longer) is more effective than Short-Term investment. We obtained some initial results by experimenting with Vietnam's stock data set from 2016 to 2020, with 50 stocks with a high market capitalization (data as of the end of 2020). Long-Term investments tend to provide more stable returns, and the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio is higher. Moreover, the bidirectional GRU model, combined with the attention mechanism, gives quite good results compared to other models. In addition, processing the missing data using the forward fill method also shows better results than when the missing data problem is not addressed. © 2023 IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

Empirical results show that our LSTM neural networks are able to achieve minor predictive errors since the average of the MSE of the 10 holding periods is 0.00047, the average of the MAE is 0.01634, and predict the direction of returns with an average accuracy over the 10 investment periods of 95.8%.

We solve multiple optimization instances and train a machine learning model in advance, which we use to solve new instances. Previous works have shown that the predictions of classification algorithms enable us to solve optimization problems much faster than commercial solvers. What distinguishes this paper from the previous work is that we use a prescriptive algorithm, Optimal Policy Trees (OPT), instead of classification algorithms. Whereas classification algorithms aim to predict the correct label and consider all other labels equally undesirable, a prescriptive approach takes into account all the available decision options and their counterfactuals. We first introduce an algorithm that is purely based on OPT and also its extension. We compare their performance with Optimal Classification Trees (OCT) on various MICO problems. Test problems include transportation optimization, portfolio optimization, facility location, and hybrid vehicle control. We also experiment on real-world instances taken from the Mixed Integer Programming Library. OPT-based methods have a significant edge on finding feasible solutions, whereas OCT-based methods have a slight edge on the degree of suboptimality. The proposed extension of the pure OPT algorithm improves on the suboptimality of the solutions the algorithm produces.  © 2023 INFORMS.},

Three main conclusions are drawn. First, deep learning in a supervised framework can work in portfolio management with our tuned model. Second, our deep LSTM model with an SD selection filter has enhanced the feature extraction ability to construct an index-tracking portfolio. Third, the linear activator, rectified linear unit, cooperated with SD methods can better reduce the estimation errors than the nonlinear activator in our deep LSTM model. These findings can implement on the portfolio construction in the neural network field. Additionally, entropy suggests to evaluate the learning effect of forecasting.

	abstract = {Index funds are substantially preferred by investors nowadays, and market sensitivities are instrumental in managing index funds. An index fund is a mutual fund aiming to track the returns of a predefined market index (e.g., the S &P 500). A basic strategy to manage an index fund is replicating the index’s constituents and weights identically, which is, however, cost-ineffective and impractical. To address this issue, it is required to replicate the index partially with accurately predicted market sensitivities. Accordingly, we propose a novel partial-replication method via learning to predict market sensitivities. We first examine deep-learning models to predict market sensitivities in a supervised manner with our data-processing methods. Then, we propose a partial-index-tracking optimization model controlling the net predicted market sensitivities of the portfolios and index to be the same. These processes’ efficacy is corroborated by our experiments on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200. Our experiments show a significant reduction of the prediction errors compared with historical estimations and competitive tracking errors of replicating the index utilizing fewer than half of the entire constituents. Therefore, we show that applying deep learning to predict market sensitivities is promising and that our portfolio construction methods are practically effective.

Using both macro and market data, they construct indicators for growth, inflation, and policy to track the business cycle and for risk appetite since 1950. They then use a random forest algorithm on those indicators to identify macro regimes that drive tail risks that matter for portfolio construction around a US 60/40 equity/bond portfolio. Based on real-time regime probabilities, they implement one of three dynamic asset allocation overlays: 1) switch between a 60/40 portfolio and cash, 2) rotate between equities and bonds, and 3) allocate to commodities/gold. The overlays materially enhanced risk-adjusted returns compared with a static 60/40 portfolio since 1950, although results were mixed over time. © 2024 Portfolio Management Research.

This research presents a portfolio rebalancing model that leverages the power of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to optimize asset allocation decisions and enhance portfolio performance. For this purpose, initially, the assets are classified based on the SVM technique to identify the most favorable assets. Secondly, a widely accepted mean–variance optimization technique is employed by this method to balance risk and return objectives, accommodating diverse transaction costs, time horizons, and other realistic conditions, thus facilitating the selection of assets and their respective weights for both initial investment and the rebalancing of the existing portfolio. Further, to assess the effectiveness of the portfolio rebalancing model incorporating SVM, comprehensive historical testing and performance analyses are conducted using historical data from the Indian Stock Market. This evaluation is contrasted with outcomes derived from other prevalent machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. By comparing the results from different methodologies, the study highlights the superior efficacy of the SVM-based portfolio rebalancing model in achieving optimal asset allocation in a dynamic financial landscape. © King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals 2024.},

	abstract = {In the stock market, accurate trend judgment and reasonable asset distribution are effective ways to obtain ideal return. However, the real stock market is affected by the objective economic environment, investors’ expected return and other potential factors, which makes the classical portfolio strategy face more challenges and pressures. How to build a reliable portfolio strategy in an uncertain environment will be a scientific problem worthy of in-depth discussion. To address this issue, this paper combines machine learning with rough set to establish a new rough set theory prediction model, quantitatively dividing the stock data into three categories and targetedly predicting the future trend according to the complexity. Based on the proposed prediction model, a new portfolio strategy is proposed by integrating the mean-variance model. Firstly, for reducing the volatility and noise of the original data of stock price, outlier processing (OP) and wavelet denoising (WD) are utilized. Secondly, for the sake of pertinently forecasting the future trend of different characteristic stock price, a three-way prediction (TWP) decisions approach is constructed based on multiscale permutation entropy (MPE), probabilistic rough set (PRS), variational modal decomposition (VMD) and deep learning. Finally, 20 stocks of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are taken as research samples to verify the scientificity and rationality of the portfolio strategy. The results show that the proposed approach not only provides scientific support and reference for investors’ investment decisions, but also provides a new investment strategy theory and method for the investment decisions of the stock market. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Although it is generally accepted that options help to improve the market, there is still an improvement for the portrayal of their unique properties in portfolio problems. In this paper, an intelligent option portfolio model is developed that allows selling options contracts to earn option fees and considers the high leverage of options in the market. Deep learning methods are used to predict the forward price of the underlying asset, making the model smarter. It can find an optimal option portfolio that maximizes the final wealth among the call and put options with multiple strike prices. We use the duality theory to analyze the marginal contribution of initial assets, risk tolerance limit, and portfolio leverage limit for the final wealth. The leverage limit of the option portfolio has a significant impact on the return. To satisfy the investors with different risk preferences, we also give the conditions for the option portfolio to gain a risk-free return and replace the Conditional Value-at-Risk. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the intelligent option portfolio model obtains a satisfactory out-of-sample return, which is significantly positively correlated with the volatility of the underlying asset and negatively correlated with the forecast error of the forward price. The risk- free option model is effective in achieving the goal of no drawdown and gaining satisfactory returns. Investors can adjust the balance point between returns and risks according to their risk preference. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Mean-variance portfolio optimization models are sensitive to uncertainty in risk-return estimates, which may result in poor out-of-sample performance. In particular, the estimates may suffer when the number of assets considered is high and the length of the return time series is not sufficiently long. This is precisely the case in the cryptocurrency market, where there are hundreds of crypto assets that have been traded for a few years. We propose enhancing the mean-variance (MV) model with a pre-selection stage that uses a prototype-based clustering algorithm to reduce the number of crypto assets considered at each investment period. In the pre-selection stage, we run a prototype-based clustering algorithm where the assets are described by variables representing the profit-risk duality. The prototypes of the clustering partition are automatically examined and the one that best suits our risk-aversion preference is selected. We then run the MV portfolio optimization with the crypto assets of the selected cluster. The proposed approach is tested for a period of 17 months in the whole cryptocurrency market and two selections of the cryptocurrencies with the higher market capitalization (175 and 250 cryptos). We compare the results against three methods applied to the whole market: classic MV, risk parity, and hierarchical risk parity methods. We also compare our results with those from investing in the market index CCI30. The simulation results generally favor our proposal in terms of profit and risk-profit financial indicators. This result reaffirms the convenience of using machine learning methods to guide financial investments in complex and highly-volatile environments such as the cryptocurrency market. © 2023, The Author(s).},

This paper morphed the potential asset selection and the optimal portfolio construction rather than focusing on one. A large volume of sample data from 25 stocks is used for the experiment from the National Stock Exchange, India, between January 2005 and December 2021. Initially, a 3-step screening approach, an asset selection method is applied to select potential assets. The 3-steps comprise data choice, fundamental screening, and the Long Short Term Memory model anticipating real-time stock prices to shortlist stocks with higher expected returns. The suggested approach is effective in determining the quality of assets. Further, the optimal asset allocation is done by introducing a novel exponentially weighted-mean-variance model. This exponential weighting scheme outperforms the classical Mean-Variance model when applied to the maximum Sharpe ratio model. The proposed model outperforms the five baseline techniques in terms of the Sharpe ratio and average potential returns and risks. Additionally, the proposed model’s resilience across diversified time frames is tested through the incorporation of multiple time windows, demonstrating robustness of the performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a benchmark testing set and evaluation system for quantum computers. Our tests do not focus on the topology of quantum computers or the specific implementation details of preparing quantum bits. Instead, we examine the overall performance of quantum computers from the perspective of users. Inspired by traditional computer benchmark tests such as SPECCPU2017, we integrate existing scalable quantum applications and algorithms to generate a testing set that covers algorithms such as search, machine learning, factorization, portfolio optimization, and entanglement state preparation, effectively simulating real workloads. By running the testing set, we can understand the performance of current quantum computers and generate a comprehensive score by combining our evaluation system, which consists of sub-scores of various backend features, including quantum gate error rate, entanglement between quantum bits, cross talk, and connectivity. These sub-scores are calculated based on the program features of the testing cases combined with their running results, where the program features are analyzed through the logical circuits of the testing cases. We incorporate Hellinger fidelity and polarization rescaling into each benchmark to calculate the fidelity of the running results. Through our evaluation system, researchers can be guided toward research directions and understand how far quantum computers are from solving practical problems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The main challenge in empirical asset pricing is forecasting the future value of assets traded in financial markets with a high level of accuracy. Because machine learning methods can model relationships between explanatory and dependent variables based on complex, non-linear, and/or non-parametric structures, it is not surprising that machine learning approaches have shown promising forecasting results and significantly outperform traditional regression methods. Corresponding results were achieved for CAT bond premia forecasts in the primary market. However, since secondary market data sets have a panel data structure, it is unclear whether the results of primary market studies can be applied to the secondary market. Against this background, this study aims to build the first out-of-sample forecasting model for CAT bond premia in the secondary market, comparing different modeling approaches. We apply random forest and neural networks as representatives of machine learning methods and linear regression based on a comprehensive data set of CAT bond issues and across various forecasting settings and show that random forest forecasts are significantly more precise. Because the lack of transparency of machine learning methods may limit their applicability, especially for institutional investors, we show ways to identify important variables in the context of random forest price forecasting. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Meta-algorithm, one of the machine learning algorithms, has the advantage of combining different base expert algorithm, which can greatly reduce the risk of choosing wrong experts, especially in the case of the base expert algorithm being very sensitive to the expert selection. In this paper, we investigate the online portfolio selection problem using Online Gradient Update (OGU) and Online Newton Update (ONU) meta-algorithms to combine expert advice for price prediction, in order to avoid the prediction bias caused by using a single expert that uses a fixed parameter. In addition, we theoretically analyze the price prediction algorithms’ regret bounds, which can guarantee that the prediction algorithms perform as well as the optimal combined prediction algorithm in hindsight. More importantly, we establish an online portfolio optimization model based on the price estimator, and obtain the portfolio update formula via Lagrange method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to test the performance of the proposed strategies in several real-world stock markets. The empirical results show that our strategies are competitive and efficient in the diverse financial environment. © Operational Research Society 2024.},

	abstract = {We propose a new asset pricing model that is applicable to the big panel of return data. The main idea of this model is to learn the conditional distribution of the return, which is approximated by a step distribution function constructed from conditional quantiles of the return. To study conditional quantiles of the return, we propose a new conditional quantile variational autoencoder (CQVAE) network. The CQVAE network specifies a factor structure for conditional quantiles with latent factors learned from a VAE network and nonlinear factor loadings learned from a “multi-head” network. Under the CQVAE network, we allow the observed covariates such as asset characteristics to guide the structure of latent factors and factor loadings. Furthermore, we provide a two-step estimation procedure for the CQVAE network. Using the learned conditional distribution of return from the CQVAE network, we propose our asset pricing model from the mean of this distribution, and additionally, we use both the mean and variance of this distribution to select portfolios. Finally, we apply our CQVAE asset pricing model to analyze a large 60-year US equity return dataset. Compared with the benchmark conditional autoencoder model, the CQVAE model not only delivers much larger values of out-of-sample total and predictive R 2’s, but also earns at least 30.9% higher values of Sharpe ratios for both long-short and long-only portfolios. © 2023 American Statistical Association.},

However, machine learning’s use in portfolio volatility predictions and optimization has only been recently explored and requires further investigation to prove valuable in real-world settings. We thus propose an effective method that accomplishes both these tasks and is targeted at people who are new to the realm of finance. This paper explores (a) a novel approach of using supervised machine learning with the Random Forest algorithm to predict portfolio volatility value and categorization and (b) a flexible method taking into account users’ restrictions on stock allocations to build an optimized and customized portfolio. Our framework also allows a diversified number of assets to be included in the portfolio. We train our model using historical asset prices collected over 8 years for six mutual funds and one cryptocurrency. We validate our results by comparing the volatility predictions against recent asset prices obtained from Yahoo Finance.

	abstract = {Portfolio management facilitates trading off risks against returns for multiple financial assets. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most promising algorithms for portfolio management. However, these state-of-the-art RL algorithms only complete the task of portfolio management, i.e., acquire the different asset features of portfolio, without considering the global context information from portfolio, which leads to non-optimal portfolio representations; Moreover, the corresponding optimizations are implemented using only the loss function in the viewpoint of RL, without considering the relationships between the local asset information and global context embeddings, which leads to non-optimal portfolio policies. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a Task-Context Mutual Actor–Critic (TC-MAC) algorithm for portfolio management. Specifically, TC-MAC algorithm is developed based on: (1) representation learning introduces a proposed Task-Context (TC) learning algorithm, which not only encodes the task (i.e., acquire different asset features) of portfolio, but also encodes the global dynamic context of portfolio, thus which helps to learn optimal portfolio embeddings; (2) policy learning introduces a proposed Mutual Actor–Critic (MAC) framework, which can measure the relationships between local embedding of each asset and global context embeddings by maximizing mutual information, the corresponding Mutual-Information loss function combines with RL loss function (i.e., Actor–Critic loss) to collectively optimize the whole algorithm, thus which helps to learn optimal portfolio policies. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TC-MAC algorithm over the well-known traditional portfolio methods and these state-of-the-art RL algorithms, at the same time, show its advantageous transferability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

The framework aims to balance profit maximization and risk management through the Margin Adjustment Module and the Maintenance Detection Module. Margin Trader supports various Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms and offers traders the flexibility to customize critical settings, such as equity allocation, margin ratios, and maintenance requirements, to suit diverse market conditions, individual preferences, and risk tolerance. Experimental results demonstrate that Margin Trader effectively learns profitable trading strategies and hedges risks in both bullish and bearish markets, outperforming other baseline models with the highest Sharpe ratio. © 2023 Owner/Author.},

During the process of constructing an investment portfolio, investors typically face with two important decisions on portfolio selection and portfolio allocation. This article aims to delve into the realm of portfolio optimization by applying the time series clustering method to historical data of stock returns on the Vietnamese stock market. The VNIndex (VNINDEX) from January 2, 2013, to December 31, 2022 was collected for analysis. About methodology, we utilize hierarchical clustering, which can be applied to a single time series (UTS) or multiple time series (MTS). The resulting portfolio was constructed by selecting stocks from these clusters based on their Sharpe ratio, a measure that finely makes balance between the risk and return. Afterward, we determine the optimal portfolio weights using the Markowitz’s Mean - Variance model, enabling us to create two distinct portfolios: MV_UTS and MV_MTS. Furthermore, our analysis encompasses dynamic evaluation using a rolling window, shedding light on how different methods respond to events impacting financial markets, such as crises. This study provides valuable insights into the application of clustering techniques in portfolio optimization and elucidates the performance and sensitivity of these methods under diverse market conditions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {This paper delves into the impact of FOMC policy announcements and meeting minutes on the reallocation of US assets at the fund level. We address the challenge of uncertain reallocation scenarios through employing a data imputation technique with random forest forecasts and fund-level features. We then quantify the most predictive information from FOMC policy statements and meeting minutes through constructed diffusion indices using a supervised learning approach. By conducting predictive fixed-effect regression analyses, we unveil the significant role of incorporating textual predictors derived from FOMC statements. Our findings reveal that positive and negative signals in FOMC announcements have contrasting effects on changes in US asset allocation. Additional exercises demonstrate that net assets and reallocation channels matter for the responses of funds to FOMC statements. We also find substantial evidence of the increased attention paid to FOMC announcements after the 2008 crisis. This heightened attention notably impacts funds that adjust US holdings using their own capital. Furthermore, we examine the presence of home bias among US and non-OECD funds in comparison to other OECD-based funds. Our analysis suggests the potential presence of a home bias among US and non-OECD funds. © 2023},

	abstract = {Portfolio management plays a significant role in wealth management. A wise selection of assets in a portfolio may give a higher return. Higher returns are directly proportional to higher risk. The main concern is how to balance risk and return. An optimized stock portfolio is constructed by selecting the best possible combination of stocks that maximizes return with minimum risk. Financial Indicators (FI) and Technical Indicators (TI) are commonly used for assessing a stock’s performance. Also, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques are popular for optimized portfolio construction. However, none of the existing literature utilized FI, TI, and MCDM together for stock portfolio management. Therefore, this paper proposes an MCDM and Deep Learning (DL) based stock portfolio selection model. An MCDM method named Additive Ratio ASsessment (ARAS) is offered to select the stocks that did well in the past. After the ARAS-based stock selection, a DL model is employed to predict the one-day ahead stock price movement. This help to invest in the stock which will move upward. The proposed model is tested on the 43 stocks that are listed in the NSE. ARAS ranked the stocks based on the values of various FI. The top 15 ARAS-ranked stocks are selected and then Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) as DL model is applied to predict the next day’s closing price using TI. The predicted trend of the stock is accurate at 87.34% on average. Based on the prediction the uptrend stock is suggested to include in the portfolio. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.},

	abstract = {Dynamic asset allocation involves adjusting asset weights based on performance to reduce risks according to market conditions. This paper proposes a novel framework called safety asset allocation reinforcement learning (AARL), which combines multiple protective dynamic asset allocation strategies (PDAS) to minimize risks through reinforcement learning (RL). The framework integrates eight validated PDAS that maintain their unique characteristics. To implement the proposed framework, a novel RL environment and agent were developed to invest in PDAS using three high-probability actions. The agent receives state and reward information from the environment and is trained using the proximal policy optimization algorithm to output weights for investing. The actions are PDAS, which facilitates for diversified investments and the learning of various combinations that are suitable for market conditions. Three experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed Safety AARL framework. The first experiment demonstrates the validity of adjusting weights using the framework. The second experiment demonstrates that the framework outperforms existing techniques during global market decline. The third experiment demonstrates that risk is minimized, outperforming the latest methods for asset allocation. Overall, the results demonstrate that the Safety AARL framework outperforms existing techniques by minimizing risks and maintaining stable returns by combining the advantages of multiple PDAS. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the economy experiencing rapid growth in recent years, more individuals have started venturing into the stock market. Precisely forecasting the rate of return can mitigate investment risks for stock investors and significantly enhance their investment returns. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the 3-factor Fama-French model (FF3) are widely recognized in academic and practical settings. This model comparison provides frameworks to analyze the relationship between portfolio risk and return in inefficient markets, contributing to applied data science in finance behavior. This research utilized the Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm to forecast the returns of a diversified portfolio in the Hanoi stock market (HNX) from 2010 to 2022. Initially, this study calculated the factors and subsequently constructed diversified portfolios. Subsequently, the explanatory power of the CAPM and FF3 models were compared using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) algorithm. Finally, this research incorporated the SVR algorithm within the FF3 framework to develop a predictive model. The research findings demonstrate that the FF3 model provides a superior explanation to the CAPM model. Additionally, the study reveals that the SVR algorithm outperforms the OLS algorithm in terms of efficiency, as it yields lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values. Nevertheless, despite its advantages, the FF3 model still falls short regarding explanatory factors. Consequently, the next research direction entails replacing the FF3 model with a more comprehensive multi-factor model, anticipating obtaining an enhanced predictive model. © 2023, Institute of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

Existing forecasting models mainly forecasting one-step ahead, and cannot retain the complex characteristics of financial time series data such as serial correlation and the long-term time-dependent relationship. On the other hand, the large-scale data makes the training of the deep learning models a time-consuming process. Therefore, how to forecast financial time series multi-step ahead efficiently has become a key point to improve the asset management capability.

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate what competencies and attributes preregistrant pharmacists draw upon in job interviews. Methods: We used a virtual mock job interview assessment asking preregistrant pharmacists to apply for an entry-level pharmacist position. Data were analyzed using a team-based framework analysis using an inductive and deductive approach and mapping responses to the National Competency Standards. Results: A total of 143 interview transcripts were included in the analysis. The top skills mentioned were leadership of self (98.6%) and communication and collaboration (96.5%). Despite graduating from a course with an integrated research curriculum, participants rarely reflected on research skills (31.5%) and no participant discussed any expertise in clinical topics or knowledge of specific professional services. Responses generally lacked specific skills and skills were spoken about broadly without relating to evidence/experience and were often not targeted to the job description. A proposal for educators aligned with competency standards was also developed based on the findings. Conclusion: Preregistrant pharmacists perceive experience within the workforce and communication and collaboration as the most desired by employers for entry-level pharmacy positions. Education and research competencies were seen as least useful to the job. There was a disconnect between skills gained in university and translation to practice. Academics could enhance the better preregistrant pharmacists’ reflection of the skills and competencies they have developed employability by (1) providing portfolio management from the beginning of the course that collects evidence and maps to competencies; (2) integrating learning opportunities across all competencies; and (3) regular skills coaching/mentoring from practicing pharmacists to ensure students are aware of current needs in the job market. © 2023 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy},

	abstract = {One-shot non-autoregressive neural networks, different from RL-based ones, have been actively adopted for solving combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, which can be trained by the objective score in a self-supervised manner. Such methods have shown their superiority in efficiency (e.g. by parallelization) and potential for tackling predictive CO problems for decision-making under uncertainty. While the discrete constraints often become a bottleneck for gradient-based neural solvers, as currently handled in three typical ways: 1) adding a soft penalty in the objective, where a bounded violation of the constraints cannot be guaranteed, being critical to many constraint-sensitive scenarios; 2) perturbing the input to generate an approximate gradient in a black-box manner, though the constraints are exactly obeyed while the approximate gradients can hurt the performance on the objective score; 3) a compromise by developing soft algorithms whereby the output of neural networks obeys a relaxed constraint, and there can still occur an arbitrary degree of constraint-violation. Towards the ultimate goal of establishing a general framework for neural CO solver with the ability to control an arbitrary-small degree of constraint violation, in this paper, we focus on a more achievable and common setting: the cardinality constraints, which in fact can be readily encoded by a differentiable optimal transport (OT) layer. Based on this observation, we propose OT-based cardinality constraint encoding for end-to-end CO problem learning with two variants: Sinkhorn and Gumbel-Sinkhorn, whereby their violation of the constraints can be exactly characterized and bounded by our theoretical results. On synthetic and real-world CO problem instances, our methods surpass the state-of-the-art CO network and are comparable to (if not superior to) the commercial solver Gurobi. In particular, we further showcase a case study of applying our approach to the predictive portfolio optimization task on real-world asset price data, improving the Sharpe ratio from 1.1 to 2.0 of a strong LSTM+Gurobi baseline under the classic predict-then-optimize paradigm. © 2023 11th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2023.

	abstract = {For most active investors treasury bonds (govs) provide diversification and thus reduce the risk of a portfolio. These features of govs become particularly desirable in times of elevated risk which materialize in the form of the flight-To-safety (FTS) phenomenon. The FTS for govs provides a shelter during market turbulence and is exceptionally beneficial for portfolio drawdown risk reduction. However, what if the unsatisfactory expected return from treasuries discourages higher bonds allocations? This research proposes a solution to this problem with Deep Target Volatility Equity-Bond Allocation (DTVEBA) that dynamically allocate portfolios between equity and treasuries. The strategy is driven by a state-of-The-Art recurrent neural network (RNN) that predicts next-day market volatility. An analysis conducted over a twelve year out-of-sample period found that with DTVEBA an investor may reduce treasury allocation by two (three) times to get the same Sharpe (Calmar) ratio and overper-forms the S&P500 index by 43% (115%).  © 2023 Tomasz Kaczmarek et al., published by Sciendo.},

We propose using the task loss to learn a metric which parameterizes a loss to train the model. This approach does not alter the optimal prediction model itself, but rather changes the model learning to emphasize the information important for the downstream task. This enables us to achieve the best of both worlds: a prediction model trained in the original prediction space while also being valuable for the desired downstream task. We validate our approach through experiments conducted in two main settings: 1) decision-focused model learning scenarios involving portfolio optimization and budget allocation, and 2) reinforcement learning in noisy environments with distracting states.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach to optimize a robust portfolio ensemble. The method uses a deep generative model to generate diverse and high-quality sub-portfolios combined to form the ensemble portfolio. The generative model consists of a convolutional layer, a stateful LSTM module, and a dense network. During training, the model takes a randomly sampled batch of Gaussian noise and outputs a population of solutions, which are then evaluated using the objective function of the problem. The weights of the model are updated using a gradient-based optimizer. The convolutional layer transforms the noise into a desired distribution in latent space, while the LSTM module adds dependence between generations. The dense network decodes the population of solutions. The proposed method balances maximizing the performance of the sub-portfolios with minimizing their maximum correlation, resulting in a robust ensemble portfolio against systematic shocks. The approach was effective in experiments where stochastic rewards were present. Moreover, the results (Fig. 1) demonstrated that the ensemble portfolio obtained by taking the average of the generated sub-portfolio weights was robust and generalized well. The proposed method can be applied to problems where diversity is desired among co-optimized solutions for a robust ensemble.

	abstract = {Surrogate models are frequently used to replace costly engineering simulations. A single surrogate is frequently chosen based on previous experience or by fitting multiple surrogates and selecting one based on mean cross-validation errors. A novel stacking strategy will be presented in this paper. This new strategy results from reinterpreting the model selection process based on the generalization error. For the first time, this problem is proposed to be translated into a well-studied financial problem: portfolio management and optimization. In short, it is demonstrated that the individual residues calculated by leave-one-out procedures are samples from a given random variable ∊i, whose second non-central moment is the i-th model’s generalization error. Thus, a stacking methodology based solely on evaluating the behavior of the linear combination of the random variables ∊i is proposed. At first, several surrogate models are calibrated. The Directed Bubble Hierarchical Tree (DBHT) clustering algorithm is then used to determine which models are worth stacking. The stacking weights can be calculated using any financial approach to the portfolio optimization problem. This alternative understanding of the problem enables practitioners to use established financial methodologies to calculate the models’ weights, significantly improving the ensemble of models’ out-of-sample performance. A study case is carried out to demonstrate the applicability of the new methodology. Overall, a total of 124 models were trained using a specific dataset: 40 Machine Learning models and 84 Polynomial Chaos Expansion models (which considered 3 types of base random variables, 7 least square algorithms for fitting the up to fourth order expansion’s coefficients). Among those, 99 models could be fitted without convergence and other numerical issues. The DBHT algorithm with Pearson correlation distance and generalization error similarity was able to select a subgroup of 23 models from the 99 fitted ones, implying a reduction of about 77% in the total number of models, representing a good filtering scheme which still preserves diversity. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the weights obtained by building a Hierarchical Risk Parity (HPR) portfolio perform better for various input random variables, indicating better out-of-sample performance. In this way, an economic stacking strategy has demonstrated its worth in improving the out-of-sample capabilities of stacked models, which illustrates how the new understanding of model stacking methodologies may be useful. © 2023 Ozelim et al.

	abstract = {We present the design and the implementation of a kernel principal component regression software that handles training datasets with a million or more observations. Kernel regressions are nonlinear and interpretable models that have wide downstream applications, and are shown to have a close connection to deep learning. Nevertheless, the exact regression of large-scale kernel models using currently available software has been notoriously difficult because it is both compute and memory intensive and it requires extensive tuning of hyperparameters.While in computational science distributed computing and iterative methods have been a mainstay of large scale software, they have not been widely adopted in kernel learning. Our software leverages existing high performance computing (HPC) techniques and develops new ones that address cross-cutting constraints between HPC and learning algorithms. It integrates three major components: (a) a state-of-the-art parallel eigenvalue iterative solver, (b) a block matrix-vector multiplication routine that employs both multi-threading and distributed memory parallelism and can be performed on-the-fly under limited memory, and (c) a software pipeline consisting of Python front-ends that control the HPC backbone and the hyperparameter optimization through a boosting optimizer. We perform feasibility studies by running the entire ImageNet dataset and a large asset pricing dataset.  © 2023 Owner/Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study analyzes the explanatory power of the latent factor conditional asset pricing model for the Korean stock market using an autoencoder. The autoencoder is a type of neural network in machine learning that can extract latent factors. Specifically, we apply the conditional autoencoder (CA) model that estimates factor exposure as a flexible nonlinear function of covariates. Our main findings are as follows. The CA model showed excellent explanatory power not only in the entire sample but also in several subsamples in the Korean market. Also, because of this explanatory power, it can better explain market anomalies compared to the traditional asset pricing models. As a result of examining investment strategies using pricing error, the CA model measures the expected return of stocks better than the traditional asset pricing model. In addition, the CA model indicates that the firm characteristic variables are important in asset pricing conditional on macro-financial states, such as the global financial crisis and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The result shows that the major variables considered in the explanation of stock returns through the CA model may vary depending on the time. This is expected to provide a broader perspective on asset pricing through the CA model in the future. Copyright: © 2023 Kim et al.

	abstract = {The Philippine stock market, just like most of its neighbors in the region, was seriously impacted by the global pandemic COVID-19. Investors remain hopeful while continuing to seek great ones in the damaged market. This paper developed a methodology for portfolio selection and optimization with the use of technical analysis, machine learning techniques, and portfolio optimization model. The combined methods of technical analysis, K-means clustering algorithm, and mean-variance portfolio optimization model will result in the development of the proposed TAKMV method. The study aims to integrate these three important analyses to identify portfolio investments. This paper uses the average annual risk and annual rate of return data for the years 2018 and 2020 to form the clusters and assessed the stocks that correspond to the investor's technical strategy such as Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) and Hybrid MACD with Arnaud Legoux Moving Average (ALMA). This paper solved the risk minimization problem on selected shares of the companies, based on the mean-variance portfolio optimization model. There are 230 and 239 companies for 2018 and 2020, respectively, listed in Philippine Stock Market, and all simulations were performed in MATLAB environment platform. Results showed that MACD strategy dominates the MACD-ALMA strategy in terms of the number of assets with a positive annual rate of return. The MACD works efficiently in the pre-COVID-19 condition while MACD-ALMA works efficiently during-COVID-19 condition, regardless of the number of assets with a positive annual rate of return. The results also show that the maximum expected portfolio return (RP) can be achieved using the MACD and MACD-ALMA in the pre-and during-COVID-19 conditions, respectively. The MACD-ALMA shows an advantage during high-risk market conditions and can also provide maximum RP. The performance of the TAKMV method was validated by applying its results and comparing it to the next year's historical price. The 2018 results were compared to 2019 data and the 2020 results were compared to 2021 data. For consistency, the comparison was applied to the same company per portfolio. Simulation results show that the MACD strategy is more effective compared to MACD-ALMA. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Financial market has systemic complexity and uncertainty. For investors, return and risk often coexist. How to rationally allocate funds into different assets and achieve excess returns with effectively controlling risk are main problems to be solved in the field of portfolio optimization (PO). At present, due to the influence of modeling and algorithm solving, the PO models established by many researchers are still mainly focused on single-stage single-objective models or single-stage multi-objective models. PO is actually considered as a multi-stage multi-objective optimization problem in real investment scenarios. It is more difficult than the previous single-stage PO model for meeting the realistic requirements. In this paper, the authors proposed a mean-improved stable tail adjusted return ratio-maximum drawdown rate (M-ISTARR-MD) PO model which effectively characterizes the real investment scenario. In order to solve the multi-stage multi-objective PO model with complex multi-constraints, the authors designed a multi-stage constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with orthogonal learning (MSCMOEA-OL). Comparing with four well-known intelligence algorithms, the MSCMOEA-OL algorithm has competitive advantages in solving the M-ISTARR-MD model on the proposed constructed carbon neutral stock dataset. This paper provides a new way to construct and solve the complex PO model. © 2023, The Editorial Office of JSSC & Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

	abstract = {Choosing the optimal portfolio is an ongoing challenging research area and a complex process involving selecting the best investment plan according to various factors, such as investor preferences for expected return, risk, and duration of investments. Although various methods have been presented so far, they failed to obtain a holistic approach to the existing data, and the need for a comprehensive mechanism based on the investor’s time preferences is felt. In this paper, by considering the fundamental characteristics, technical indicators, time-series data, and budget constraints, we developed a comprehensive and time-varying methodology to forecast stock prices and form an optimal portfolio. The proposed method consists of recurrent neural networks and multi-objective mathematical programming (MOMP). In this regard, the bidirectional long short-term memory model is adopted and optimized by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, called PSO-BiLSTM. Furthermore, the hybrid MOMP models are developed based on long-, mid-, and short-term strategies to provide the optimal portfolio of the stocks with investment constraints. The main objectives of this research were to address the following issues: (1) developing a precise and efficient model to forecast the stocks prices, taking account of fundamental characteristics, technical indicators, time-series data appropriate to the period considered by the investor, (2) providing an optimized time-varying portfolio through developing the hybrid MOMP models, and generally (3) proposing a holistic step-by-step methodology considering three groups of market data and deep learning to apply investment constraints as well as investor’s time preferences in the process of building more realistic portfolios. The results highlight that the tuned PSO-BiLSTM method performs better than the conventional methods in all three constructed models using fundamental characteristics, technical indicators, and time-series data. Compared to the conventional methods, the proposed methodology outperforms in generalization power, is more precise in forecasting prices, and provides portfolios with more profit. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

However, the trading market is complex, making return prediction a challenging task. To address this issue, existing works have utilized various technical indicators as inputs to enhance predictive accuracy. However, these indicators are often proprietary and kept confidential by quantitative funds and researchers, limiting their accessibility. In this paper, we propose a federated learning-based method that leverages multiple parties' technical indicators for stock return prediction without disclosing them. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods in terms of prediction accuracy. Additionally, the proposed method achieves higher portfolio return through portfolio optimization using the Mean-variance Optimization model compared to traditional approaches. The proposed method offers a promising solution for stock return prediction while maintaining the confidentiality of technical indicators. © 2023 IEEE.},

Although these models show impressive full-sample gross alphas, their performance net of transaction costs post-2004 is close to zero. By training on longer prediction horizons and using efficient portfolio construction rules, the authors demonstrate that ML-based investment strategies can still yield significant positive net returns.

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization is an important part of portfolio management. It realizes the trade-off between maximizing expected return and minimizing risk. A better portfolio optimization model helps investors achieve higher expected returns under the same risk level. This paper proposes a novel prediction based portfolio optimization model. This model uses autoencoder (AE) for feature extraction and long short term memory (LSTM) network to predict stock return, then predicted and historical returns are utilized to build a portfolio optimization model by advancing worst-case omega model. In order to show the effect of AE, the LSTM network without any feature extraction methods is used as a benchmark in stock prediction. Also, an equally weighted portfolio is considered as a comparison to reveal the advantage of the worst-case omega model. Empirical results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the equally weighted portfolio, and a high risk–return preference is more suitable to this model. In addition, even after deducting transaction fees, this model still achieves a satisfying return and performs better than the state-of-art prediction based portfolio optimization models. Thus, this paper recommends applying this model in practical investment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Composite predictors based on machine learning have long-short portfolio returns that remain significant even with transaction costs up to 300 basis points. By comparing 46 variations of machine-learning models, we find that the models with the highest return predictability apply a feed-forward neural network or composite predictors, with extending rolling windows, including elastic net as a feature reduction, and using percent ranked returns as a target.

However, the MV optimization model derives a set of optimal portfolios. The limited rationality and experience of the company's manager, as well as the conflict of interest with the shareholders, require several experts to help the manager make investment decisions. Moreover, experts' unique preferences require negotiation through interaction to reach a consensus, which is not considered in existing group interactive optimization algorithms. The social network group decision-making (SNGDM) method is an effective approach for reaching consensus. Notably, in addition to the trust relationships, experts' intrinsic risk preferences and rational levels affect investment decisions and change with the decision-making process. Another important problem is reaching consensus with finite interaction costs. Although dynamic opinion is considered by current minimum cost models, the impact of dynamic trust on consensus is neglected. This research aims to develop a group interactive portfolio optimization method based on SNGDM (SNGDM-PO) to address the mentioned limitations. First, we introduce consensus into group interactive optimization algorithms and develop an adaptive learning model that simulates group preferences. Then, we combine dynamic intrinsic influence and extrinsic trust to generate experts' dynamic weights. To reduce interaction consensus costs, we propose an adaptive consensus feedback mechanism that minimally adjusts for dynamic opinion and trust with a time constraint. Finally, empirical study and comparison findings demonstrate that the SNGDM-PO can efficiently obtain consensus with minimum adjustments and low interaction costs and produce high group satisfaction. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The rapid development of quantitative portfolio optimization in financial engineering has produced promising results in AI-based algorithmic trading strategies. However, the complexity of financial markets poses challenges for comprehensive simulation due to various factors, such as abrupt transitions, unpredictable hidden causal factors, and heavy tail properties. This paper aims to address these challenges by employing heavy-tailed preserving normalizing flows to simulate the high-dimensional joint probability of the complex trading environment under a model-based reinforcement learning framework. Through experiments with various stocks from three financial markets (Dow, NASDAQ, and S&P), we demonstrate that Dow outperforms the other two based on multiple evaluation metrics in our testing system. Notably, our proposed method mitigates the impact of unpredictable financial market crises during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a lower maximum drawdown. Additionally, we explore the explanation of our reinforcement learning algorithm, employing the pattern causality method to study interactive relationships among stocks, analyzing dynamics of training for loss functions to ensure convergence, visualizing high-dimensional state transition data with t-SNE to uncover effective patterns for portfolio optimization, and utilizing eigenvalue analysis to study convergence properties of the environment’s model. © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Recent works in learning-integrated optimization have shown promise in settings where the optimization problem is only partially observed or where general-purpose optimizers perform poorly without expert tuning. By learning an optimizer g to tackle these challenging problems with f as the objective, the optimization process can be substantially accelerated by leveraging past experience. The optimizer can be trained with supervision from known optimal solutions or implicitly by optimizing the compound function f ◦ g. The implicit approach may not require optimal solutions as labels and is capable of handling problem uncertainty; however, it is slow to train and deploy due to frequent calls to optimizer g during both training and testing. The training is further challenged by sparse gradients of g, especially for combinatorial solvers. To address these challenges, we propose using a smooth and learnable Landscape Surrogate M as a replacement for f ◦ g. This surrogate, learnable by neural networks, can be computed faster than the solver g, provides dense and smooth gradients during training, can generalize to unseen optimization problems, and is efficiently learned via alternating optimization. We test our approach on both synthetic problems, including shortest path and multidimensional knapsack, and real-world problems such as portfolio optimization, achieving comparable or superior objective values compared to state-of-the-art baselines while reducing the number of calls to g. Notably, our approach outperforms existing methods for computationally expensive high-dimensional problems. © 2023 Neural information processing systems foundation. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The recent crisis caused by COVID-19 directly affected consumption habits and the stability sof financial markets. In particular, the football industry has been hit hard by this pandemic and therefore has more volatile stock prices. Given this new scenario, further research is needed to accurately estimate the value of the shares of football clubs. In this paper, we estimate an asset pricing model in football clubs with different compositions of risk nature using non-linear techniques of artificial neural networks. Usually, asset pricing models have been estimated with linear methods such as ordinary least squares. Our results show a precision higher than 90% for all the estimated models, which far exceeds those shown by linear methods in the previous literature. We find that the residual represents about 40% of the variance of the price-dividend ratio. Long-term risks follow in importance, and above all, the habit component and its behaviour in the face of changes. The importance of the residual component exists due to a low correlation between the asset price and consumer behaviour, but to a much lesser extent than that shown in previous studies. The estimation carried out with artificial neural networks, both the Deep Learning methods and especially the Quantum Neural Network, opens up new possibilities to estimate more efficiently the pricing of financial assets in the football industry. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Stock-market prediction is the task of forecasting future movements or trends in stock prices or overall market behavior. Investors can able to locate companies that offer the highest dividend yields and lower their investment risks by using a trading strategy. It's important to note that predicting stock markets accurately is extremely challenging and no approach can guarantee consistent success. Markets are influenced by a multitude of factors and there is inherent uncertainty involved. For instance, predicting stock-market prices is commonly used in financial disciplines, such as trade-execution strategies, portfolio optimization and stock-market forecasting. Therefore, it's crucial to approach stock-market prediction cautionsly and use it as a tool for informed decision-making rather than relying solely on predictions. To overcome the challenges, we proposed a new hybrid deep-learning technique to forecast future stock prices. Deep learning has recently enjoyed considerable success in some domains due to its exceptional capacity for handling data. In this research, we propose a hybrid technique of Mobile U-Net V3 and BiLSTM (Bi-Long Short-Term Memory) to predict stock prices. Initially, we utilize the min-max normalization method to normalize the input data in the preprocessing stage. After normalizing the data, we utilize hybrid deep learning techniques of Mobile U-Net V3 and BiLSTM to predict the closing price from stock data. To experiment, we collect data from Apple, Inc. and S&P 500 stock. The evaluation metrics Pearson's Correlation (R), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Normalization Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) were utilized to calculate the outcomes of the DL stock-prediction methods. The Mobile U-Net V3-BiLSTM model outperformed other techniques in forecasting stock-market prices. © 2023, Scientific Research Support Fund of Jordan. All rights reserved.},

This systematic survey explores various scenarios employing deep learning in financial markets, especially the stock market. A key requirement for our methodology is its focus on research papers involving backtesting. That is, we consider whether the experimentation mode is sufficient for market practitioners to consider the work in a real-world use case. Works meeting this requirement are distributed across seven distinct specializations. Most studies focus on trade strategy, price prediction, and portfolio management, with a limited number considering market simulation, stock selection, hedging strategy, and risk management. We also recognize that domain-specific metrics such as “returns” and “volatility” appear most important for accurately representing model performance across specializations. Our study demonstrates that, although there have been some improvements in reproducibility, substantial work remains to be done regarding model explainability. Accordingly, we suggest several future directions, such as improving trust by creating reproducible, explainable, and accountable models and emphasizing prediction of longer-term horizons—potentially via the utilization of supplementary data—which continues to represent a significant unresolved challenge. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Increasing the speed of convergence and accuracy in stock selection and creating a portfolio with the highest rate of return and the lowest rate of risk in investment is of particular importance. This paper aims to present a whale optimization-based multi-objective approach to optimize the portfolio in the financial markets. The proposed optimization approach, called PMP-WOA (periodic multi-population whale optimization approach), creates the Pareto fronts of portfolios at an appropriate convergence time and proper accuracy to achieve higher return and liquidity and lower risk as its main goals. The dynamic use of multiple sub-populations and the exchange of information between them have a great impact on increasing the accuracy of solutions and proximity to the real Pareto front. Moreover, controlling the parameters of the algorithm using learning automata leads to the selection of the appropriate search path and speeds up the convergence of the approach. Furthermore, PMP-WOA creates an archive of non-dominated solutions that increases the variety of solutions, which is one of the important issues in creating the Pareto front. In order to evaluate PMP-WOA, it is first used with four multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms to optimize a number of ZDT mathematical test functions, and then with 6 existing meta-heuristic algorithms for portfolio optimization. The obtained results show the lower generational distance that means higher accuracy, higher number of Pareto solutions, and higher value of maximum spread, and lower value of spacing, which together indicate higher diversity of the proposed solution in the optimization of the ZDT test functions and also in the portfolio optimization compared to the other existing methods. The higher convergence speed of PMP-WOA approach is another evaluation parameter that shows its superiority compared to other existing methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Consequently, our paper contributes to the literature by developing a new cryptocurrency portfolio model framework based on the CVaR risk measure and a deep reinforcement learning optimization framework. We use the data from cryptocurrency market starting 2015 to 2021, unfolding that CVaR measure with deep learning outperforms the traditional portfolio construction technique. Compared with traditional economic parameter-based portfolio models, our model free based approach can capture the nonlinear compounding effect of multiple risk shocks by deep reinforcement learning on the risk distribution with economic structural breakdown.

	abstract = {Low-risk pricing anomalies, characterized by lower returns in higher-risk stocks, are prevalent in equity markets and challenge traditional asset pricing theory. Previous studies primarily relied on linear regression methods, which analyze a limited number of factors and overlook the advantages of machine learning in handling high-dimensional data. This study aims to address these anomalies in the Chinese market by employing machine learning techniques to measure systematic risk. A large dataset consisting of 770 variables, encompassing macroeconomic, micro-firm, and cross-effect factors, was constructed to develop a machine learning-based dynamic capital asset pricing model. Additionally, we investigated the differences in factors influencing time-varying beta between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs, providing economic explanations for the black-box issues. Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of random forest and neural networks, with the four-layer neural network performing best and leading to a substantial rise in the excess return of the long–short portfolio, up to 0.36%. Notably, liquidity indicators emerged as the primary drivers influencing beta, followed by momentum. Moreover, our analysis revealed a shift in variable importance during the transition from SOEs to non-SOEs, as liquidity and momentum gradually replaced fundamentals and valuation as key determinants. This research contributes to both theoretical and practical domains by bridging the research gap in incorporating machine learning methods into asset pricing research. © 2023 by the authors.},

Weekly data on the US financial system, consumer sentiment, producer sentiment, and investor sentiment is collected from 21 January 1994 to 27 December 2019, and different models are developed to predict the one-week-ahead levels of financial stress in the US financial system. We find that models using sentiment indices outperform those relying solely on historical financial stress and risk data. This result is robust to comparisons with an alternative deep learning method and out-of-sample predictions. It constitutes an argument in favor of behavioral finance and Minsky's (Knell, 2015) financial instability hypothesis against the Efficient Market Hypothesis. As it concretely identifies the main indicators for predicting US financial stress one week in advance, the study provides relevant recommendations for policymakers and investors in terms of macroprudential policies and portfolio management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

This solver fills the gap due to the inadequacy of the particle swarm optimization algorithm for high-dimensional instances. We aim to extend the classical mean-variance formulation by maximizing a modified version of the Sharpe ratio subject to cardinality, box, and budget constraints. The algorithm involves a projection operator to deal with these three constraints simultaneously. Further, we implicitly control transaction costs thanks to a rebalancing constraint handled by a suitable exact penalty function. In addition, we develop an ad hoc mutation operator to modify candidate exemplars in the highest level of the swarm. The experimental results, using three large-scale data sets, show that including this procedure improves the accuracy of the solutions. Then, a comparison with other variants of the LLSO algorithm and two state-of-the-art swarm optimizers points out the outstanding performance of the proposed solver in terms of exploration capabilities and solution quality. Finally, we assess the profitability of the portfolio allocation strategy in the last five years using an investable pool of 1119 constituents from the MSCI World Index. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

Modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a framework for optimizing sequential trader decisions but lacks theoretical guarantees of convergence. On the other hand, the performances on real financial trading problems are strongly affected by the goodness of the signal used to predict returns. To disentangle the effects coming from return unpredictability from those coming from algorithm un-trainability, we investigate the performance of model-free DRL traders in a market environment with different known mean-reverting factors driving the dynamics. When the framework admits an exact dynamic programming solution, we can assess the limits and capabilities of different value-based algorithms to retrieve meaningful trading signals in a data-driven manner. We consider DRL agents that leverage classical strategies to increase their performances and we show that this approach guarantees flexibility, outperforming the benchmark strategy when the price dynamics is misspecified and some original assumptions on the market environment are violated with the presence of extreme events and volatility clustering. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Multi-objective portfolio optimisation is a critical problem researched across various fields of study as it achieves the objective of maximising the expected return while minimising the risk of a given portfolio at the same time. However, many studies fail to include realistic constraints in the model, which limits practical trading strategies. This study introduces realistic constraints, such as transaction and holding costs, into an optimisation model. Due to the non-convex nature of this problem, metaheuristic algorithms, such as NSGA-II, R-NSGA-II, NSGA-III and U-NSGA-III, will play a vital role in solving the problem. Furthermore, a learnheuristic approach is taken as surrogate models enhance the metaheuristics employed. These algorithms are then compared to the baseline metaheuristic algorithms, which solve a constrained, multi-objective optimisation problem without using learnheuristics. The results of this study show that, despite taking significantly longer to run to completion, the learnheuristic algorithms outperform the baseline algorithms in terms of hypervolume and rate of convergence. Furthermore, the backtesting results indicate that utilising learnheuristics to generate weights for asset allocation leads to a lower risk percentage, higher expected return and higher Sharpe ratio than backtesting without using learnheuristics. This leads us to conclude that using learnheuristics to solve a constrained, multi-objective portfolio optimisation problem produces superior and preferable results than solving the problem without using learnheuristics. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

	abstract = {The Stock prediction has traditionally been an attractive and challenging topic for investors and researchers. Traditionally, people concern more about predicting stock prices, less effort has been made to recommend stocks for constructing a profitable portfolio. Moreover, in existing methods for stock prediction, most of them construct models based on one or two kinds of features like stock prices, news sentiment, or simple technical indicators, and disregard the importance of multi-source information fusion. In response to this concern, we propose a novel model T2V_TF based on deep learning by combining both Time2Vec and Transformer technologies. To introduce more diverse information into the proposed model, we further conduct an in-depth exploration of the extraction and fusion of multi-source heterogeneous information, which includes the trading data, time–frequency features, Alpha 101 and Alpha 191 technical indicators, and sentiment scores. Moreover, to increase the ranking ability of our model, T2V_TF takes the ranking loss as the loss function instead of the widely used regression loss. Finally, all the technological innovations of this paper are verified on the portfolio constructed based on the A50 stocks from the Chinese stock market. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed T2V_TF can get better portfolio cumulative return, compared with other models including the multi-layer perceptron, the support vector machine, the gradient boosting decision trees, the long short-term memory model, and the attention-based long short-term memory model, and the Transformer. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs) have become increasingly significant and challenging in the evolutionary computation (EC) community. This article proposes a superiority combination learning distributed particle swarm optimization (SCLDPSO) for LSOPs. In algorithm design, a master–slave multi-subpopulation distributed model is adopted, which can obtain the full communication and information exchange among different subpopulations, further achieving the diversity enhancement. Moreover, a superiority combination learning (SCL) strategy is proposed, where each worse particle in the poor-performance subpopulation randomly selects two well-performance subpopulations with better particles for learning. In the learning process, each well-performance subpopulation generates a learning particle by merging different dimensions of different particles, which can fully combine the superiorities of all the particles in the current well-performance subpopulation. The worse particle can significantly improve itself by learning these two superiority combination particles from the well-performance subpopulations, leading to a successful search. Experimental results show that SCLDPSO performs better than or at least comparable with other state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms on both CEC2010 and CEC2013 large-scale optimization test suites, including the winner of the competition on large-scale optimization. Besides, the extended experiments with increasing dimensions to 2000 show the scalability of SCLDPSO. At last, an application in large-scale portfolio optimization problems further illustrates the applicability of SCLDPSO. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Stock is a financial instrument that has a high variation. One way to determine the risk of a stock is to estimate the Value at Risk. However, Value at Risk cases tend to have fluctuating variations over time and are difficult to model because they are hypothesized to be non-linear. To capture this, modeling is carried out with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH). Meanwhile, identification of non-linear models can be solved using machine learning methods, one of which is Support Vector Regression (SVR) which is sensitive to over fitting cases. To produce an optimal model, reinforced with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). By using this combination, the hybrid SVR-GARCH-KDE method is obtained. The results of this method can show that the Hybrid-SVR-GARCH-KDE method is good for estimating the Value at Risk on return of LQ45 stock price data for the period January 2018 to March 2021 which has the smallest PEB and PBV. From this method, portfolio optimization was carried out and resulted in a decision that investments in the Trade, Services, and Investment sectors as well as mining were profitable for investors. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

In them, users voluntarily provide relevant information, including educated knowledge on investments, reacting to the state of the stock markets in real-time and, often, influencing this state. We are interested in the user forecasts in financial, social media messages expressing opportunities and precautions about assets. We propose a novel Targeted Aspect-Based Emotion Analysis (TABEA) system that can individually discern the financial emotions (positive and negative forecasts) on the different stock market assets in the same tweet (instead of making an overall guess about that whole tweet). It is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning streaming algorithms. The system comprises a constituency parsing module for parsing the tweets and splitting them into simpler declarative clauses; an offline data processing module to engineer textual, numerical and categorical features and analyse and select them based on their relevance; and a stream classification module to continuously process tweets on-the-fly. Experimental results on a labelled data set endorse our solution. It achieves over 90% precision for the target emotions, financial opportunity, and precaution on Twitter. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work in the literature has addressed this problem despite its practical interest in decision-making, and we are not aware of any previous NLP nor online Machine Learning approaches to TABEA. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With artificial intelligence and data quality development, portfolio optimization has improved rapidly. Traditionally, researchers in the financial market have utilized the modern portfolio theory for portfolio optimization; however, with the recent development of artificial intelligence, attempts to optimize portfolios with reinforcement learning are increasing. Many studies have developed reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms and conducted portfolio optimization research. However, in reality, thus far, the securities industry thus has used the modern portfolio theory, which is sufficiently valuable. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there has yet to be an attempt to combine modern portfolio theory and reinforcement learning. To bridge this gap in the literature, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that combines the modern portfolio theory and a deep learning approach. As far as we know, we are the first to combine recent deep learning technology and traditional financial theory. Specifically, we solved the multimodal problem through the Tucker decomposition of a model with the input of technical analysis and stock return covariates. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms regarding the Sharpe ratio, annualized return, and maximum drawdown. In addition, the proposed method dynamically changes the weight according to the market trend, unlike other state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

The development of online optimization techniques indicates that dynamic learning algorithms are an effective approach to portfolio construction, although they do not evaluate the risk associated with each investment decision. In this work, the performance of the well-known Online Gradient Descent (OGD) algorithm is evaluated in comparison with a proposed approach that incorporates portfolio risk using β control of portfolio assets modeled with the CAPM strategy and considering a time-varying β that follows a random walk. Thus, the traditional OGD algorithm and the OGD with β constraints are compared with the Uniform Constant Rebalanced Portfolio (UCRP) and two specific indexes for the Brazilian market, consisting of small caps and the assets belonging to the Bovespa index. The experiments have shown that β control, combined with an appropriate definition of the β interval by the investor, is an efficient strategy, regardless of market periods with gains or losses. Moreover, time-varying β has been shown to be an efficient measure to force the desired correlation with the market and also to reduce the volatility of the portfolio, especially during hazardous bear markets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Recently, models that based on Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) have yielded superior results in many sequence modeling tasks. The ability of Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and interactions makes it possible to apply it in the field of portfolio management (PM). However, the built-in quadratic complexity of the Transformer prevents its direct application to the PM task. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based PM framework called LSRE-CAAN, with two important components: a long sequence representations extractor and a cross-asset attention network. Direct Policy Gradient is used to solve the sequential decision problem in the PM process. We conduct numerical experiments in three aspects using four different cryptocurrency datasets, and the empirical results show that our framework is more effective than both traditional and state-of-the-art (SOTA) online portfolio strategies, achieving a 6x return on the best dataset. In terms of risk metrics, our framework has an average volatility risk of 0.46 and an average maximum drawdown risk of 0.27 across the four datasets, both of which are lower than the vast majority of SOTA strategies. In addition, while the vast majority of SOTA strategies maintain a poor turnover rate of approximately greater than 50% on average, our framework enjoys a relatively low turnover rate on all datasets, efficiency analysis illustrates that our framework no longer has the quadratic dependency limitation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

In both in-sample and out-of-sample results, technical indicators display statistically significant ability, exceeding that of economic variables. To gain valuable insight into which indicators are comparatively relevant to the price of EUAs, three types of forecasting methods: univariate predictive regression, dimensionality reduction techniques, and ensemble learning algorithms are applied. Results show that the first diffusion index in the principal component regression and partial least squares model is greatly influenced by the changes of technical indicators, while only having a weak association with economic variables. With respect to ensemble learning algorithms like Xgboost, greater importance is given to technical indicators compared to economic variables when making predictions. Furthermore, technical indicators demonstrate stable economic value to investors in the form of positive CER gains. Our findings present novel evidence for the predictive capacity of technical indicators and can assist policymakers in formulating sustainable and effective energy policies. © 2023},

How to grasp the movement of stock price and predict its trend have been the focus of investors and investment companies. Since expert stock comments contain abundant essential information for investment decisions, how to identify the topic of expert stock comments with high precision and efficiency is an important research topic. However, the existing methods usually employ single feature selection strategies for topic identification of stock comments, which may lead to low accuracy. Thus, to deal with this limitation, we propose a multi-level information fusion method to construct a topic identification system of stock comments. Specifically, we firstly fuse various complementary feature selection methods via a multi-view learning framework which can comprehensively represent text-based topics. In addition, regarding the decision process, we propose a fusion strategy based on belief value which can further improve the classification performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed multi-level information fusion method is not only superior to other methods in terms of classification, it is also able to accurately capture topics of expert stock comments. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Besides, as the accuracy of estimation gets improved, the agent will reduce her consumption and riskless asset investment and enhance her investment in the non-concealed risky asset.

The study is based on the daily prices of cryptocurrencies. TQC is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with the Actor-Critic architecture. It alleviates the overestimation problem of traditional value learning algorithm. In this paper, the data of cryptocurrencies are first processed as input to the networks. The inputs to the networks include not only the closing prices of cryptocurrencies, but also the relative strength index, moving average line, and moving average convergence divergence. Various metrics measuring algorithm returns and algorithm stability are used as evaluation criteria in this paper. In this paper, common deep reinforcement learning algorithms are compared. The experimental results show that the TQC algorithm has a highest return of 33.9 % during the test period, which is 3 %, 3 % and 15.6 % higher than A2C, PPO and DDPG respectively. And, the TQC algorithm has the highest stability of return, which is an important evaluation metric for portfolio management algorithms. Despite the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, the performance of the TQC algorithm has remained relatively stable. This illustrates the positive effects of the TOC algorithm.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Financial portfolio management is reallocating the asset into financial products, whose goal is to maximize the profit under a certain risk. Since AlphaGo debated human professional players, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm has been widely used in various fields, including quantitative trading. The multi-agent system is a relatively new research branch in DRL, and its performance is better than that of a single agent in most cases. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm with trend consistency regularization (TC-MARL) to find the optimal portfolio. Here, we divide the trend of stocks of one portfolio into two categories and train two different agents to learn the optimal trading strategy under these two stock trends. First, we build a trend consistency (TC) factor to recognize the consistency of several stocks from one portfolio. When the trend of these stocks is consistent, the factor is defined as 1; the trend is inconsistent, the factor is defined as - 1. Based on it, a novel regularization related to the weights is proposed and added to the reward function, named TC regularization. And the TC factor value is used as the sign of the regularization term. In this way, two agents with different reward functions are constructed, which have the same policy model and value model. Afterward, the proposed TC-MARL algorithm will dynamically switch between the two trained agents to find the optimal portfolio strategy according to the market status. Extensive experimental results on the Chinese Stock Market show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to empirically test, from a regulatory portfolio management standpoint, the application of liquidity-adjusted risk techniques in the process of getting optimum and investable economic-capital structures in the Gulf Cooperation Council financial markets, subject to applying various operational and financial optimization restrictions under crisis outlooks. Design/methodology/approach: The author implements a robust methodology to assess regulatory economic-capital allocation in a liquidity-adjusted value at risk (LVaR) context, mostly from the standpoint of investable portfolios analytics that have long- and short-sales asset allocation or for those portfolios that contain long-only asset allocation. The optimization route is accomplished by controlling the nonlinear quadratic objective risk function with certain regulatory constraints along with LVaR-GARCH-M (1,1) procedure to forecast conditional risk parameters and expected returns for multiple asset classes. Findings: The author’s conclusions emphasize that the attained investable economic-capital portfolios lie-off the efficient frontier, yet those long-only portfolios seem to lie near the efficient frontier than portfolios with long- and short-sales assets allocation. In effect, the newly observed market microstructures forms and derived deductions were not apparent in prior research studies (Al Janabi, 2013). Practical implications: The attained empirical results are quite interesting for practical portfolio optimization, within the environments of big data analytics, reinforcement machine learning, expert systems and smart financial applications. Furthermore, it is quite promising for multiple-asset portfolio management techniques, performance measurement and improvement analytics, reinforcement machine learning and operations research algorithms in financial institutions operations, above all after the consequences of the 2007–2009 financial crisis. Originality/value: While this paper builds on Al Janabi’s (2013) optimization algorithms and modeling techniques, it varies in the sense that it covers the outcomes of a multi-asset portfolio optimization method under severe event market scenarios and by allowing for both long-only and combinations of long-/short-sales multiple asset. The achieved empirical results, optimization parameters and efficient and investable economic-capital figures were not apparent in Al Janabi’s (2013) paper because the prior evaluation were performed under normal market circumstances and without bearing in mind the impacts of the 2007–2009 global financial crunch. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Firstly, the study compared the two theoretical models, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and FF3, and investigated that FF3 explains volatility in portfolio returns better than CAPM. Furthermore, to forecast the return rate, the study applied Ordinary Least Square (OLS) for CAPM and FF3 and SVR methods for CAPM and FF3. This research used the roll window method to train-test the model and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model’s accuracy.

For those intervals, data scarcity is a problem that is often dealt with by making distribution assumptions.

In our experiments we use the Conditional Value-at-Risk as our risk measure, and we work with data from 2007 until 2021 to evaluate our methodology. Our results show that, by incorporating features, the out-of-sample performance of our strategy outperforms the equally-weighted portfolio.

In this work, we address this task by considering Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for stock portfolio management. We first generate a three-dimension fuzzy vector to describe the current trend for each stock. Then the fuzzy terms, along with other stock market features, such as prices, volumes, and technical indicators, were used as the input for five algorithms, including Advantage Actor-Critic, Trust Region Policy Optimization, Proximal Policy Optimization, Actor-Critic Using Kronecker Factored Trust Region, and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient. An average ensemble method was applied to obtain trading actions. We set SP100 component stocks as the portfolio pool and used 11 years of daily data to train the model and simulate the trading. Our method demonstrated better performance than the two benchmark methods and each individual algorithm without fuzzy extension. In practice, real market traders could use the trained model to make inferences and conduct trading, then retrain the model once in a while since training such models is time0consuming but making inferences is nearly simultaneous. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Various deep learning techniques have recently been developed in many fields due to the rapid advancement of technology and computing power. These techniques have been widely applied in finance for stock market prediction, portfolio optimization, risk management, and trading strategies. Forecasting stock indices with noisy data is a complex and challenging task, but it plays an important role in the appropriate timing of buying or selling stocks, which is one of the most popular and valuable areas in finance. In this work, we propose novel hybrid models for forecasting the one-time-step and multi-time-step close prices of DAX, DOW, and S&P500 indices by utilizing recurrent neural network (RNN)–based models; convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU)-CNN, and ensemble models. We propose the averaging of the high and low prices of stock market indices as a novel feature. The experimental results confirmed that our models outperformed the traditional machine-learning models in 48.1% and 40.7% of the cases in terms of the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, in the case of one-time-step forecasting and 81.5% of the cases in terms of the MSE and MAE in the case of multi-time-step forecasting. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Index tracking is the problem of building a portfolio that replicates the performance of a market index. The recent applications involving deep learning in index tracking are more focused on the learned information rather than on the framework that consumes this information. The problem is that, until now, a way to enable the extension of the index tracking models that adopt machine learning was not yet proposed. Nowadays, the mathematical programming framework is more flexible when considering model extensions to build realistic portfolios. Thus, this study presents ways to combine generative adversarial networks (GANs) within this framework to generate market simulations incorporated into a base index tracking model. It was verified how the simulations generated by GANs can impact the out-of-sample performance of the portfolio and how to deal with their instability, by using real data from the Brazilian market. To achieve this, two evolutionary metaheuristics were proposed to solve the multiple scenario index tracking problem. The proposed evolutionary algorithms minimize the tracking errors of a portfolio in multiple market simulations generated by GANs. The performance of the proposed algorithms was compared against another evolutionary metaheuristic that solves the index tracking problem using historical data. It was possible to observe that the scenario-based dominance genetic algorithm (SDM-SBDGA-GAN) was able to perform better than the real data genetic algorithm (RDM-GA) and the sample average approximation genetic algorithm (SDM-SAAGA-GAN). These results open doors for new applications of synthetic data in the construction of portfolios using more realistic constraints and other tracking objectives. This work also brings discussions about problems related to the application of GANs in this context. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {For more than a half-century, credit risk management has used credit scoring models at each of the well-defined stages of credit risk management. Application scoring is used to decide whether to grant a loan or not, while behavioral scoring is used mainly for portfolio management and to take preventive actions in case of default signals. In both cases, social network data has recently been shown to be valuable to increase the predictive power of these models, especially when the borrower's historical data is scarce or not available. This study aims to understand the dynamics of creditworthiness assessment performance and how it is influenced by credit history, repayment behavior, and social network features. To accomplish this, we build up a machine learning classification framework demonstrating its value analyzing 97,000 individuals and companies from the moment they obtained their first loan up to 12 months afterward. Our original and massive dataset allowed us to characterize each borrower according to its credit behavior, and socioeconomic relationships. Our study finds that credit scoring based on borrowers’ history improves performance at a decreasing rate during the first six months and then stabilizes. The most notable effect on the performance of credit scoring based on social network features occurs in loan applications; for personal scoring, this effect prevails for approximately six months, while for business scoring, social network features add value throughout the entire study period. These findings are of great value to improve credit risk management and optimize the combined use of both the traditionally exploited information and new alternative data sources. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As a fundamental problem in algorithmic trading, portfolio optimization aims to maximize the cumulative return by continuously investing in various financial derivatives within a given time period. Recent years have witnessed the transformation from traditional machine learning trading algorithms to reinforcement learning algorithms due to their superior nature of sequential decision making. However, the exponential growth of the imperfect and noisy financial data that is supposedly leveraged by the deterministic strategy in reinforcement learning, makes it increasingly challenging for one to continuously obtain a profitable portfolio. Thus, in this work, we first reconstruct several deterministic and stochastic reinforcement algorithms as benchmarks. On this basis, we introduce a risk-aware reward function to balance the risk and return. Importantly, we propose a novel interpretable stochastic reinforcement learning framework which tailors a stochastic policy parameterized by Gaussian Mixtures and a distributional critic realized by quantiles for the problem of portfolio optimization. In our experiment, the proposed algorithm demonstrates its superior performance on U.S. market stocks with a 63.1% annual rate of return while at the same time reducing the market value max drawdown by 10% when back-testing during the stock market crash around March 2020. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In such a high-dimensional framework, the asset allocation is unfeasible because the covariance matrix obtained with the usual sample estimators cannot be inverted. This paper proposes a new shrinkage estimator based on reinforcement learning for large covariance matrices that is optimal in the context of portfolio selection. The resulting estimator is entirely data-driven since the optimal shrinkage intensity is given by optimizing neural network weights. This paper presents two different architectures: a standard fully connected network for a classical Policy Gradient Agent (PGA) and a Gated Recurrent Unit for a Recurrent Policy Gradient Agent (RPGA). To show the validity of the proposal, an application to asset allocation with Industry portfolios is provided. The results indicate that the RPGA-based approach in shrinkage estimation provides the best performance in out-of-sample comparison. © 2023 The Author(s)},

The results suggest that reinforcement learning consistently outperforms the established methods and benchmarks in both experiments, even when using a very similar degree of diversification in portfolio construction and the same input data.

In this paper, on the basis of HAR model based on high-frequency trading data, Lasso and random forest method in machine learning are combined to conduct model feature selection, and the nonlinear characteristics among variables are depicted by neural network method, so as to construct several new realized volatility models based on machine learning. Then, the performance of various models in forecasting the realized volatility of Shanghai stock index is evaluated and compared. The empirical results show that, the introduction of the jump component can improve the out-of-sample forecasting accuracy of realized volatility in the stock market. The HAR extended models based on Lasso and random forest for feature selection have significantly better out-of-sample prediction performance than the traditional HAR models and GARCH models. Using the neural network method to describe the nonlinear characteristics of volatility can further improve the out-of-sample prediction accuracy of the model. The Lasso-NN-J model has the best in-sample and out-sample prediction performance among all the investigated forecasting models, and the prediction performance of the model is quite robust under the simulation tests of different rolling window widths, different high-frequency data of individual stocks and random sampling. © 2024 Chinese Chemical Society.

Almost all markets around the world declined, with varying degrees, at the 2008 financial crisis and 2020 COVID-19 market crisis. Correlation-based diversification optimized portfolios were not spared, generating significant losses. Recent research on an unsupervised machine learning method of time-series clustering using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as a distance measure have shown research promise as a financial portfolio diversification method and shown prospects of overcoming correlation convergence issues during periods of downside event risks. This research validates the applicability of DTW cluster diversification to achieve persistent portfolio performance in international developed markets, even across periods of market weakness. Results showed outperformance of mean and median return and Sharpe metrics of optimally weighted DTW cluster diversification, against correlation-based diversification methods.

J. Finance 68(3):987–1035]. implying that both the disaster and the long-run risk paradigm can be extended toward explaining movements in the stock-bond correlation. Copyright: © 2022 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {Portfolio management is a critical problem in both machine learning and finance communities. To predict the returns of assets, existing studies have been leveraging side information to mine price-sensitive indicators, i.e., factors. However, with the brisk expansion of factor collection, existing factor selection methods face two main issues, i.e., high-cost and low-precision. In this paper, we first formalize the task of online factor selection as an online learning problem where a learner selects a set of factors in each round and aims to minimize the long-term regret. Then, we propose a Randomized onlinE Factor sElection fRamework, named REFER, which not only is particularly devised to address the above two issues, but also can widely serve for any existing multifactor models. Specifically, by studying the regret of existing factor-selecting policies, we propose two randomized policies along with their bandit variants that achieve sublinear regrets. The bandit variants further improve computational efficiency, and achieve a balanced trade-off between cost and precision. Finally, both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and policies in terms of comprehensive evaluation criteria. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

At the highest level a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent selects among a number of discrete actions, representing low-level agents. For the low-level agents, we use a set of Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) and Hierarchical Equal Risk Contribution (HERC) models with different hyperparameters, which all run in parallel, off-market (in a simulation). The information on which the DRL agent decides which of the low-level agents should act next is constituted by the stacking of the recent performances of all agents. Thus, the modelling resembles a statefull, non-stationary, multi-arm bandit, where the performance of the individual arms changes with time and is assumed to be dependent on the recent history. We perform experiments on the cryptocurrency market (117 assets), on the stock market (46 assets) and on the foreign exchange market (28 pairs) showing the excellent robustness and performance of the overall system.

More precisely, the Fama–French BSVR three-factor estimations attain out-of-sample (testing dataset) correlation coefficients of 94% for portfolio returns for the consumption and manufacturing industries. A correlation of 92% between the predicted and experimental values of portfolio returns was found for the high-tech industry; 91% was found for the mining, construction, transportation, hotels, entertainment, and finance industries.

	abstract = {In the Black–Scholes model proposed in 1973, an investor can use a continuously rebalanced dynamic strategy to hedge the risk of a certain option, assuming that the underlying asset’s price is subject to geometric Brownian motion (a continuous-time stochastic process where the logarithm of the variable follows a Brownian motion) and the market is complete and frictionless, which is unrealistic due to the continuous changes in asset prices. The application of reinforcement learning (RL) in finance includes a variety of decision-making problems such as hedging, optimal execution, and portfolio optimization. RL can make full use of historical data or generate more data than other theories used to make decisions in finance such as stochastic control theory. There will be fewer assumptions and better performance with exploration and exploitation. In this article, we propose a reinforcement learning-based model that can help investors dynamically hedge financial products in discrete time using complex structured products: the Phoenix option (a note that only pays a coupon if the price of the underlying asset is above a certain barrier and redeems if the price breaches an autocall barrier) as an example in this paper. This model is highly expandable and can set an objective function according to the investor’s preferences; for example, the Sharpe ratio (a measure of risk-adjusted return that compares the return of an investment with its risk) is very lightweight because we do not assume the existence of an optimal hedging strategy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {High-frequency trading is an extraordinarily intricate financial task, which is normally treated as a near real-time sequential decision problem. Compared with the traditional two-phase approach, forecasting equity's trend and then weighting them by combinatorial optimization, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have shown advances in reward chasing with optimal policies. However, existing DRL-based methods either leverage portfolio optimization on low-frequency scenarios or only support a very limited number of assets with discrete action space, facing significant computing efficiency challenges. Therefore, we propose an efficient DRL-based policy optimization (DRPO) method for high-frequency trading. In particular, we model the portfolio management task with Markov Decision Process by directly inferring the equity weights in the action space guided by maximum accumulated returns. To reduce agents' interaction complexity without reducing interpretation, we detach the environment into the "static'' market states and "dynamic'' portfolio weight states. Then, we design an efficient reward expectation calculation algorithm via probabilistic dynamic programming, which enables our agents directly collect feedback away from trajectory sampling-based morass. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that solves the high-frequency portfolio optimization problem by devising an efficient continuous space policy optimization algorithm in the DRL framework. Through extensive experiments on the real-world data from Dow Jones, Coinbase and SSE exchanges, we show that our proposed DRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods. The results demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2023 ACM.},

While the idea makes intuitive sense and is also well substantiated by the widely popular Kelly criterion, we prove that it is generally possible to make systematic profits with a completely inferior price-predicting model. The key idea is to alter the training objective of the predictive models to explicitly decorrelate them from the market. By doing so, we can exploit inconspicuous biases in the market maker's pricing, and profit from the inherent advantage of the market taker. We introduce the problem setting throughout the diverse domains of stock trading and sports betting to provide insights into the common underlying properties of profitable predictive models, their connections to standard portfolio optimization strategies, and the commonly overlooked advantage of the market taker. Consequently, we prove the desirability of the decorrelation objective across common market distributions, translate the concept into a practical machine learning setting, and demonstrate its viability with real-world market data. © 2022 The Author(s)},

The Linear Upper Confidence Bound (LinUCB) algorithm based on bandit learning is a typical reinforcement learning approach that can be a data-driven approach to the portfolio problem. Most investors may have inconsistent preferences for different assets; therefore, the reward function needs to be designed to balance exploration (allocating part of the investment to searching among other alternative portfolios) and exploitation (concentrating the investment on the historically best portfolio). The study consists of developing a two-stage investing strategy that uses the supervised adaptive decision tree approach to build a pool of candidate portfolios and the reinforcement LinUCB algorithm to derive a portfolio update rule with respect to a specific utility function. The two-stage strategy has been tested on CSI300 constitute stocks listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The accumulated returns, as well as other performance measures (e.g., maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and information ratio) at different testing periods achieved by the model, can well outperform the benchmark index. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Three major roles that are used in our system are presented, and while maximizing their own targets in the Taiwan stock exchange (TWSE) historical data, they also observe trading behavior and compete with other agents. To build a trading strategy, we construct a student–teacher framework in which multi-agent targeting distills the market information and a student RL model is taught using the distilled target. The results show that our method is capable of developing profitable strategies in a quickly changing financial market. In addition, our market distilling technique has the potential to develop a flexible asset allocation strategy by using different student networks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

In contrast to classical stochastic control theory and other analytical approaches for solving financial decision-making problems that heavily reply on model assumptions, new developments from reinforcement learning (RL) are able to make full use of the large amount of financial data with fewer model assumptions and to improve decisions in complex financial environments. This survey paper aims to review the recent developments and use of RL approaches in finance. We give an introduction to Markov decision processes, which is the setting for many of the commonly used RL approaches. Various algorithms are then introduced with a focus on value- and policy-based methods that do not require any model assumptions. Connections are made with neural networks to extend the framework to encompass deep RL algorithms. We then discuss in detail the application of these RL algorithms in a variety of decision-making problems in finance, including optimal execution, portfolio optimization, option pricing and hedging, market making, smart order routing, and robo-advising. Our survey concludes by pointing out a few possible future directions for research. © 2023 The Authors. Mathematical Finance published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is an emerging field that offers the potential to overcome the limitations of classical computers and is gaining attention as the next-generation computing platform. With the growth of interest in quantum computers, the competition to develop more powerful systems has intensified, with leading companies such as IBM, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Samsung investing in the technology. They are working towards creating more advanced and practical quantum computers that can lead to new applications in various fields. Consequently, quantum computingwww.earticle.net has become a game-changer in recent years, with applications in cryptography, simulation, machine learning, and data retrieval. Quantum computing is also beingapplied to finance, giving rise to a new field known as quantum finance. This offers a unique way of processing data and information that is different from classical computing technologies. With its ability to perform complex optimization problems faster and more accurately than classical computers, quantum computing has significant potential in finance. Quantum finance has numerous advantages and limitless potential applications. For instance, it can help financial institutions better manage complex financial products like derivatives and structured products. By providing more accurate risk assessments, portfolio optimization, and trading strategies, quantum finance can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of financial markets. This enables financial institutions to make informed decisions, reduces the likelihood of financial loss, and ultimately benefits both the institutions and their customers. Quantum computing can also reduce the time and cost of complex financial calculations, such as Monte Carlo simulations. This is crucial for financial institutions, as the savings can be reinvested in other areas of the business. Additionally, quantum computing has the potential to increase the stability of financial markets by reducing market volatility and increasing investor confidence. The implementation of quantum finance requires cooperation between the financial sector and the government. Financial institutions should invest in quantum financial technologies and create the necessary infrastructure and regulations. Governments should also provide funding and support through regulation to encourage the development of quantum finance. Financial institutions, governments, and academia must work together to advance the field and maximize the potential of quantum computing in finance. However, implementing quantum finance requires expertise in both quantum computing and finance. Financial institutions need to secure human resources, such as quantum computing experts, to successfully implement quantum finance. This requires close collaboration between the financial sector and academia to develop the necessary skills. In conclusion, the potential benefits of quantum finance are vast, and its impact on the financial industry could be significant. By enhancing the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of financial markets, quantum finance has the potential to revolutionize the industry and benefit both financial institutions and their customers. It is crucial that financial institutions, governments, and academia work together to invest in and support the development of this emerging field. By exploring the potential and implications of quantum finance, this paper highlights the importance of supporting its growth, which has the potential to shape the future of finance and quantum computing. © 2023, Korean Finance Association.

It uses the reciprocal of Pearson's correlation coefficient as the loss function. Experimental results show that the MFTR model has performed well in mining alpha factors in the China A-share market over the past five years.

	abstract = {With the progress of time series prediction, several recent developments in machine learning have shown that the integration of prediction methods into portfolio selection is a great opportunity to structure investment decisions in the renewable energy industry. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to portfolio formation strategy based on a hybrid machine learning model that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-term bidirectional memory (BiLSTM) with robust input characteristics obtained from Huber's location for stock prediction and the mean-variance (MV) Markowitz model for optimal portfolio construction. Specifically, this study first applies a prediction method for stock pre-selection to ensure high-quality stock inflows for portfolio formation. Then, the predicted results are integrated into the MV model. To comprehensively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, we used two portfolio models, the MV model and the equal-weighted (1/N) portfolio model, with LSTM, BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM, and used them as references. Between January 2016 and December 2021, historical data from the Stock Exchange of Thailand 50 Index (SET50) was collected for the study. Experience shows that integrating stock pre-selection can improve VM performance, and the results of the proposed method show that they outperform comparison models in terms of Sharpe ratio, average return and risk. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

	abstract = {Constrained combinatorial optimization problems abound in industry, from portfolio optimization to logistics. One of the major roadblocks in solving these problems is the presence of non-trivial hard constraints which limit the valid search space. In some heuristic solvers, these are typically addressed by introducing certain Lagrange multipliers in the cost function, by relaxing them in some way, or worse yet, by generating many samples and only keeping valid ones, which leads to very expensive and inefficient searches. In this work, we encode arbitrary integer-valued equality constraints of the form A x ⃗ = b ⃗ , directly into U(1) symmetric tensor networks (TNs) and leverage their applicability as quantum-inspired generative models to assist in the search of solutions to combinatorial optimization problems within the generator-enhanced optimization framework of Alcazar et al (2021 arXiv:2101.06250). This allows us to exploit the generalization capabilities of TN generative models while constraining them so that they only output valid samples. Our constrained TN generative model efficiently captures the constraints by reducing number of parameters and computational costs. We find that at tasks with constraints given by arbitrary equalities, symmetric matrix product states outperform their standard unconstrained counterparts at finding novel and better solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. © 2023 The Author(s).

Previous portfolio optimization models use traditional risk measurements such as variance, which symmetrically delineate both positive and negative sides and are not practical and stable. In this paper, a new model with cardinality constraints is first proposed, in which the idiosyncratic volatility factor is used to replace traditional risk measurements and can capture the risks of the portfolio in a more accurate way. The new model has practical constraints which involve the sparsity and irregularity of variables and make it challenging to be solved by traditional Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). To solve the model, a Learning-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm based on Iϵ+ indicator (Iϵ+LGEA) is developed. In Iϵ+LGEA the Iϵ+ indicator is incorporated into the initialization and genetic operators to guarantee the sparsity of solutions and can help improve the convergence of the algorithm. And a new constraint-handling method based on Iϵ+ indicator is also adopted to ensure the feasibility of solutions. The experimental results on five portfolio trading datasets including up to 1226 assets show that Iϵ+LGEA outperforms some state-of-the-art MOEAs in most cases.  © 2021 TUP.},

	abstract = {Aiming at the problem of portfolio management，a portfolio framework based on value distributional reinforcement learning algorithm (VD-MEAC) was proposed． First，a reinforcement learning framework was established with the goal of maximizing the return of the portfolio，and the action of the agent was the weight change of the portfolio．Then，the stock factor information was selected as the state information observed by the agent．In the design of the algorithm，risks and benefits were balanced through novel techniques．In terms of risk control，the Critic network learned the entire distribution of future benefits，and excluded overconfident decision-making information to avoid the risk of overestimation．In terms of improving benefits，entropy regularization was increased，and investors were encouraged to explore the action space，avoiding falling into local optimum prematurely．In terms of numerical experiments，real stock data was selected as the financial environment，and multiple tests were performed to verify the stability of the strategy．Experimental results show that the average return of the VD-MEAC strategy is 2.490，the average Sharpe ratio is 2.978，and it is significantly better than the control group (equal weight，CSI 300，DDPG，TD3，SAC) in terms of return，maximum drawdown and Sharpe ratio，reflecting the effectiveness of the strategy. © 2023 Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

	abstract = {The authors propose a novel method to improve estimation of asset returns for portfolio optimization. This approach first performs a monthly directional market forecast using an online decision tree. The decision tree is trained on a novel set of features engineered from portfolio theory: the efficient frontier functional coefficients. Efficient frontiers can be decomposed to their functional form, a square-root second-order polynomial, and the coefficients of this function capture the information of all the constituents that compose the market in the current time period. To make these forecasts actionable, these directional forecasts are integrated to a portfolio optimization framework using expected returns conditional on the market forecast as an estimate for the return vector. This conditional expectation is calculated using the inverse Mills ratio, and the capital asset pricing model is used to translate the market forecast to individual asset forecasts. This novel method outperforms baseline portfolios, as well as other feature sets including technical indicators and the Fama–French factors. To empirically validate the proposed model, the authors employ a set of market sector exchange-traded funds. © 2023 With Intelligence LLC.},

Although recent volatility forecasting models have explored the textual content of conference calls for prediction, they suffer from modeling the long-text and representing the risk-relevant information. This work proposes to identify key sentences for robust and interpretable transcript representation learning based on the cognitive theory. Specifically, we introduce TextRank to find key sentences and leverage attention mechanism to screen out the candidates by modeling the semantic correlations. Upon on the structural information of earning conference calls, we propose a structure-based contrastive learning method to facilitate the effective transcript representation.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper presents a combined method of ensemble learning and genetics to rebalance the corporate portfolio. The primary purpose of this paper is to determine the amount of investment in each of the shares of the listed company and the time of purchase, holding or sale of shares to maximize total return and reduce investment risk. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the goals of the problem, a two-level combined intelligent method, such as a support vector machine, decision tree, network Bayesian, k-nearest neighbors and multilayer perceptron neural network as heterogeneous basic models of ensemble learning in the first level, was applied. Then, the majority vote method (weighted average) in the second stage as the final model of learning was collectively used. Therefore, the data collected from 208 listed companies active in the Tehran stock exchange (http://tsetmc.com) from 2011 to 2015 have been used to teach the data. For testing and analysis, the data of the same companies between 2016 and 2020 have been used. Findings: The results showed that the method of combined ensemble learning and genetics has the highest total stock portfolio yield of 114.12%, with a risk of 0.905%. Also, by examining the rate of return on capital, it was observed that the proposed method has the highest average rate of return on investment of 110.64%. As a result, the proposed method leads to higher returns with lower risk than the purchase and maintenance method for fund managers and companies and predicts market trends. Research limitations/implications: In the forthcoming research, there were no limitations to obtain research data were easily extracted from the site of Tehran Stock Exchange Technology Management Company and Rahvard Novin software, and simulation was performed in MATLAB software. Practical implications: In this paper, using combined machine learning methods, companies’ stock prices are predicted and stock portfolio optimization is optimized. As companies and private organizations are trying to increase their rate of return, so they need a way to predict stock prices based on specific indicators. It turned out that this algorithm has the highest stock portfolio return with reasonable investment risk, and therefore, investors, portfolio managers and market timers can be used this method to optimize the stock portfolio. Social implications: The homogeneous and heterogeneous two-level hybrid model presented in the research can be used to predict market trends by market timers and fund managers. Also, adjusting the portfolio with this method has a much higher return than the return on buying and holding, and with controlled risk, it increases the security of investors’ capital, and investors invest their capital in the funds more safely. And will achieve their expected returns. As a result, the psychological security gained from using this method for portfolio arrangement will eventually lead to the growth of the capital market. Originality/value: This paper tries to present the best combination of stock portfolios of active companies of the Tehran Stock Exchange by using the two-level combined intelligent method and genetic algorithm. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Portfolio analysis is a crucial subject within modern finance. However, the classical Markowitz model, which was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1991, faces new challenges in contemporary financial environments. Specifically, it fails to consider transaction costs and cardinality constraints, which have become increasingly critical factors, particularly in the era of high-frequency trading. To address these limitations, this research is motivated by the successful application of machine learning tools in various engineering disciplines. In this work, three novel dynamic neural networks are proposed to tackle nonconvex portfolio optimization under the presence of transaction costs and cardinality constraints. The neural dynamics are intentionally designed to exploit the structural characteristics of the problem, and the proposed models are rigorously proven to achieve global convergence. To validate their effectiveness, experimental analysis is conducted using real stock market data of companies listed in the Dow Jones Index (DJI), covering the period from November 8, 2021 to November 8, 2022, encompassing an entire year. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. Notably, the proposed model achieves a substantial reduction in costs (which combines investment risk and reward) by as much as <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$56.71\%$</tex-math> </inline-formula> compared with portfolios that are averagely selected.

Low-risk anomaly is observed from the numerical experiments through the grouping method base on stock β, demonstrating the potential irrationality for even giant companies and brands on the advanced market. Empirical analysis shows that Gaussian Process is able to model the low β stock effectively, while not feasible for stocks with high volatility. Thus, the proposed BLGPlo portfolio outperform the benchmarks in terms of cumulative excess return and Sharpe ratio.

	abstract = {In this study, we used reinforcement learning (RL) models to invest assets in order to earn returns. The models were trained to interact with a simulated environment based on historical market data and learn trading strategies. However, using deep neural networks based on the returns of each period can be challenging due to the unpredictability of financial markets. As a result, the policies learned from training data may not be effective when tested in real-world situations. To address this issue, we incorporated contrastive learning and reward smoothing into our training process. Contrastive learning allows the RL models to recognize patterns in asset states that may indicate future price movements. Reward smoothing, on the other hand, serves as a regularization technique to prevent the models from seeking immediate but uncertain profits. We tested our method against various traditional financial techniques and other deep RL methods, and found it to be effective in both the U.S. stock market and the cryptocurrency market.

	abstract = {Identifying meaningful and actionable relationships between the price movements of financial assets is a challenging but important problem for many financial tasks, from portfolio optimization to sector classification. However, recent machine learning research often focuses on price forecasting, neglecting the understanding and modelling of asset relationships. To address this, we propose a neural model for training stock embeddings that harnesses the dynamics of historical returns data to reveal the nuanced correlations between financial assets. We describe our approach in detail and discuss several practical ways it can be used in the financial domain. Specifically, we present evaluation results to demonstrate the utility of this approach, compared to several benchmarks, in both portfolio optimization and industry classification. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Recently, the global market returns are characterized by year-long episodes of high volatility, leading market traders to struggle to maximize their total return with high-frequency trading. However, in the meantime, some classical financial characteristics have striking similarities. Therefore, an increasing amount of investors are dedicated to finding and making the most of reasonable models with computer science and machine learning, in quest of a general pattern. Accordingly, we developed a comprehensive model to help some traders with optimal transaction decisions. Given that the portfolio of cash, bitcoin and gold is gradually becoming a new choice for high returns, we chose these assets as examples to build a model to forecast the closing prices of bitcoin and gold for the next trading day based on their past stream up to today with LSTM (LongShort Term Memory) Neural Network Model. To achieve the maximum return, we used the Mean-variance Model to set the investment ratio of bitcoin and gold as variables for mathematical programming and solved the multivariate equations to find the optimal portfolio. The investment weights for each trade were obtained by comparing the lowest risk portfolio and the optimal return portfolio, i.e., the minimum variance and maximum Sharpe ratio scenarios. Finally, we evaluated our strategy through quantitative strategy indices and proved its outstanding performance. © 2023 IEEE.},

Based on the analysis of financial time series using machine learning techniques with mathematically adaptive data selection, we predict the future trends of the stocks and make efficient profitable portfolio selection. It is the novelty of this work to express the training data as the union of subsets of similar data and build multiple machine learning networks, each one of which is specialised for the trends in one subset. Similar data in a subset gives ease of learning, which eventually leads to an improvement in prediction accuracy. The consideration of the possibility from one trend in the past to various outcomes in the future is another novelty. The portfolio management based on such improved learning gives the high rate of returns. When the proposed portfolio management scenario is applied to the stocks included in KOSPI index in Korea, up to 4 times more profits than the standard management are obtained. © 2023, Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

	abstract = {Learning outcomes: After studying and analysing this case, students would be able to evaluate and understand the importance and need of an infrastructure sector in a country, its inherent risks and scope of infrastructure investment and financing in India – National Infrastructure Pipeline and the important role of Non-Banking Finance Company’s (NBFC) vis-à-vis banks in infrastructure financing in India; critically analyse and recommend alternative decisions in a business problem situation using multi-criteria decision analysis, which is a tool used for business portfolio analysis; understand and evaluate the corporate portfolio management (CPM) tools used for an optimum portfolio mix to turn around companies; identify and suggest an optimum portfolio mix to turn around a finance company using CPM assessment applied to Pidun matrix; and recommend operational and strategic levers for successful turnaround implementation by using the integrated canvas on turnaround. Case overview/synopsis: On 10 May 2020, in New Delhi, India, J. Ray took charge as a full-time director of an Indian Non-Banking Finance Company – Infrastructure Finance Company (NBFC-IFC). The NBFC-IFC of the Indian Government extended long-term financial assistance to infrastructure projects in India. During the financial year (FY) 2017–2018 till FY 2019–2020, the company suffered substantial losses to the tune of US$13.7bn, with profitability experiencing a notable decline – return on assets at a negligible 0.11% and return on equity of only 0.68%. The NBFC-IFC had a declining yield on advances at 7.05%, net interest margins (NIMs) of 2.08% against a high cost of borrowing at 7.66%, a declining loan book (by 4.35%) of US$336.27bn and a fast-deteriorating asset quality with highest ever non-performing assets (NPAs) at 19.70% of its loan book. Such financial parameters, compared with that of the industry average of banks and finance companies, meant that the NBFC-IFC Ray had taken over was fast bleeding and was on the brink of being declared a sick company. In comparison, private and other government players had profitable and much healthier financials, and Ray felt that there was a need for improvement. To make things worse, Ray got to know that the Indian Government was in the final stages of setting up a new development finance institution focused on long-term infrastructure financing in India. Ray realized the question was not only of the NBFC-IFC remaining relevant but also of its existence in the fast-evolving sector. Ray wondered what could his his integrated canvas be for a turnaround strategy that could include effective management of an optimal portfolio mix. With a healthy capital-to-risk (weighted) assets ratio of 30.85% and a satisfactorily improved net worth of US$103.1bn, in the given Reserve Bank of India regulatory provisions for the NBFC-IFC including restrictive exposure norms and NBFC-IFC’s operational mandate prescribed by the Indian Government, Ray had to shift the product and sectorial investment of the NBFC-IFC to reduce the NPAs, increase loan book size and improve the yield of advances and its NIM to effectively turn around the company’s profitability. Ray realized that he needed his team to evaluate and select a product and sector strategy for this change. Complexity academic level: The present case of financing investment in infrastructure is interesting for implementation in developing economies because a lack of infrastructure is a common problem and there is a necessity of achieving a more developed infrastructure system to support accelerated economic growth in these countries. This case can be used in elective courses on corporate finance strategy and corporate portfolio management for infrastructure finance companies. This case can be taught in elective courses in post-graduate and MBA programs. This case can also be included in management development programs (MDP), executive MBA programs and executive-level courses that have subjects such as corporate finance strategy, corporate portfolio management and strategy management that focus on turnaround strategies including portfolio management for banks and finance companies.

An important aspect of this process is to be able to forecast future REITs prices, as this allows investors to achieve higher returns at lower risk. This paper examines the performance of five different machine learning algorithms in the task of REITs price forecasting: Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, k-Nearest Neighbours Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Long/Short-Term Memory Neural Networks. In addition to past REITs prices, we also use Technical Analysis indicators to assist the algorithms in the task of price prediction. While such indicators are very popular in stocks forecasting, they have never been used to forecast REITs. Our experiments show that (i) all ML algorithms produce low error and standard deviation, and are able to outperform the well-known statistical benchmark of AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and (ii) the introduction of Technical Analysis (TA) indicators into the feature set leads to an error reduction of up to 50%. © 2023 IEEE.},

The onset of the current global pandemic has led to major negative implications for the overall economy and personal financial situations. With many people losing jobs, getting reduced salaries, and exhausting their savings, they have started to invest heavily. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) reports that there were 4.9 million new Demat accounts opened in the fiscal year 2020, which was the biggest in at least ten years. Thus, the study of the Stock Exchange is very relevant to the current times. We shall explain the importance of learning about investing in the Stock Market and derive an efficient model to make real-time predictions of a stock price and build an optimized portfolio. In the finance sector, portfolio optimization is a critical responsibility. The goal of portfolio optimization is to increase return on investment while lowering portfolio risk. Due to its capacity to understand intricate correlations between input and output variables, feed-forward neural networks have been successfully used to solve portfolio optimization issues. We explore the research on portfolio optimization using feed-forward neural networks in this paper.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The paper presents an advanced version of an adaptive market-making agent capable of performing experiential learning, exploiting a “try and fail” approach relying on a swarm of subordinate agents executed in a virtual environment to determine optimal strategies. The problem is treated as a “Narrow AGI” problem with the scope of goals and environments bound to financial markets, specifically crypto-markets. Such an agent is called an “adaptive multi-strategy agent” as it executes multiple strategies virtually and selects only a few for real execution. The presented version of the agent is extended to solve portfolio optimization and re-balancing across multiple assets so the problem of active portfolio management is being addressed. Also, an attempt is made to apply an experiential learning approach executed in the virtual environment of multi-agent simulation and backtesting based on historical market data, so the agent can learn mappings between specific market conditions and optimal strategies corresponding to these conditions. Additionally, the agent is equipped with the capacity to predict price movements based on social media data, which increases its financial performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Using finite mixture normal regressions, we find that the relation between idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) and realized return is negative for one latent group and positive for the other latent group. The intercept is larger for the group with a positive relation than for the group with a negative relation; the negative relation concentrates in firms with large negative realized return in the bottom two quintiles and the positive relation concentrates in firms with large positive realized return in the top two quintiles; the likelihood of having a negative relation is positively related to price-to-value ratio estimates. Realized return has a prominent mispricing-correction component that is negative (positive) for overvalued (undervalued) firms and decreases (increases) with the degree of overvaluation (undervaluation) corrected. Overall, our findings are consistent with the positive relation between IVOL and mispricing. Our findings suggest that an overall negative relation between IVOL and realized return is driven by the negative relation between IVOL and the mispricing-correction component from overvalued firms. Rationally determined expected return cannot be negative. Evidently, an overall negative relation between IVOL and realized return does not contradict the prediction of rational asset pricing theories. © 2023 British Accounting Association},

	abstract = {Investments play a significant role in the functioning and development of the economy. Risk management is an integral part of the formation of the investment portfolio. This means that an investor must be willing to take on a certain level of risk in order to receive a certain level of return. However, when forming an investment portfolio, an investor faces such problems as market unpredictability, asset correlation, incorrect asset allocation. Therefore, when forming an investment portfolio, an investor should carefully study all possible risks and try to minimize them. The object of research is an approach to risk management in the formation of an investment portfolio using the method of reinforcement training. The basic principles of formation of the investment portfolio and determination of risks are described. The application of the method of reinforcement training for building a model of risk management of investment portfolio is considered. The process of selecting optimal investment assets based on alternative data sources that minimize risks and maximize profits is also considered. A functional model of the process of risk optimization in the formation of an investment portfolio based on machine learning methods has been developed. The functional model constructed makes it possible to build a process of risk optimization, including asset selection, risk comparison and assessment, to form an investment portfolio and monitor its risks. The study results showed that the proposed approach to the formation of the investment portfolio increased the total growth of the investment portfolio by 0.4363 compared to the base model. Also, the volatility indicator improved compared to the market, as evidenced by the percentage difference between the initial and final cash amount, which increased from 128.98 to 295.57 © 2023, Authors.

	abstract = {Investors are presented with a multitude of options and markets for pursuing higher returns, a task that often proves complex and challenging. This study examines the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in optimizing investment portfolios, comparing their performance with traditional strategies and benchmarking against American and Brazilian indices. Additionally, it was explore the impact of incorporating commodity derivatives into portfolios and the associated transaction costs. The results indicate that the inclusion of derivatives can significantly enhance portfolio performance while reducing volatility, presenting an attractive opportunity for investors. RL techniques also demonstrate superior effectiveness in portfolio optimization, resulting in an average increase of 12% in returns without a commensurate increase in risk. Consequently, this research makes a substantial contribution to the field of finance. It not only sheds light on the application of RL but also provides valuable insights for academia. Furthermore, it challenges conventional notions of market efficiency and modern portfolio theory, offering practical implications. It suggests that data-driven investment management holds the potential to enhance efficiency, mitigate conflicts of interest, and reduce biased decision-making, thereby transforming the landscape of financial investment. © 2023, Santos et al.

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization poses a significant challenge due to asset price volatility caused by various economic factors. Portfolio optimization typically aims to achieve a high risk-adjusted return through asset allocation. However, high-volatility assets such as equities can lead to significant losses in the event of crises, such as trade wars. An industry rotation strategy can reduce portfolio risk by investing in industry indexes. This research aims to develop industry rotation strategies for Thailand by analyzing previous consecutive months of economic variables with the goal of maximizing the portfolio's Sharpe ratio in the following period. Two strategies are proposed in this paper, one with cash and the other without, both of which include eight Thai industry indexes in their portfolios. Both strategies are developed using Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (Bi-LSTM) models, which generate the allocation ratio based on historical economic variable data. The models then optimize the allocation ratio by using a modified loss function to maximize the Sharpe ratio. In addition to the Sharpe ratio, the return on investment and the Calmar ratio are used to assess the performance of the strategies. The results showed that our strategies outperformed the baseline buy-and-hold SET50 and equal-weight strategies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Constructing an efficient portfolio model is very challenging since the model should reduce the investment risk and improve returns and profit. A portfolio management system is proposed based on deep reinforcement learning strategy that incorporates Holding companies performance and % of shares holding in other stocks(Holdings) as an additional feature to the reward system to dynamically analyze the perceived market condition from the real world. In order to utilize the correlation of shares effectively, we introduce a new feature, dependency factor that is modeled based on price of the holdings, % of the shares held on holdings and the total share value of holding and the price change on each trading day. This deep reinforcement learning framework uses Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed framework with dependency factor obtained better results.  © 2023 IEEE.},

It is possible to search for the best portfolio in the optimal Pareto Front for a given investor with interactive multiobjective optimization using dominance-based rough sets approach (IMO-DRSA). However, obtaining the optimal Pareto front can be impractical as the index size grows. Therefore, evolutionary multiobjective approaches (EMO) can be used to find good fronts in a reasonable time. A simulated IMO-DRSA approach was adopted and extended to offer insights on how to design interactive processes for index tracking considering the stochastic output of EMO. The extended simulated IMO-DRSA approach analyzes how different factors, such as the number of interactions and methods for cognitive effort reduction, affect the capacity of an EMO to produce good portfolios for different types of artificial investors during interactions and to maintain their goodness over time. In contrast to previous studies, this research explores various approaches for displaying potential portfolios to investors and investigates the performance of an evolutionary algorithm guided by IMO-DRSA in multiple problem instances with an increased number of objectives.  © 1997-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cryptocurrency is now widely accepted as a payment and exchange method, permeating nearly every aspect of the financial sector. Similar to the non-stationary and very erratic price movements of traditional stocks, cryptocurrency price swings are highly unpredictable. The rising popularity of cryptocurrencies has prompted an increase in the number of studies conducted to predict their future prices. The importance of cryptocurrency forecasting has grown significantly with the advent of deep learning. portfolio optimisation and decision making cannot be achieved without the creation of a smart forecasting model. The primary contribution of this study is the utilize of traditional deep learning (DL) models in combination with the three most popular ensemble learning algorithms (ensemble-averaging, bagging, and stacking) to predict the hourly values of major cryptocurrencies. Traditional DL strategies consisting of combinations of long short-term memory (LSTM), Bi-directional (BiLSTM), and convolutional layers were utilized to assess the suggested ensemble methods. The ensemble techniques were tested on their capacity to forecast the price of a cryptocurrency an hour basis (regression) and to determine whether the price will rise or fall relative to the present (classification). Our in-depth experimental research shows that combining ensemble learning with deep learning can produce robust, stable, and trustworthy forecasting strategies. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Predictor interactions play a crucial role in esti-mating risk premiums. However, current methodologies might not effectively and understandably address this. Inspired by the broad success of the self-Attention mechanism, we develop an attention-based asset pricing model in this paper, which we'll refer to as AAPM. This model, utilizing several stacked multi-head self-Attention blocks, can efficiently capture high-order factor interactions. Empirical evidence suggests that our model surpasses all other machine learning models studied in relevant finance literature in terms of out-of-sample R2. Interestingly, our model, despite having fewer predictors, outperforms its original version that incorporates all predictors as input. We attribute this phe-nomenon to negative factor interactions that detrimentally affect the latter's result. Moreover, we identify critical predictor bundles using our model. Our results demonstrate substantial economic benefits to investors and offer a novel perspective in empirical asset pricing literature.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency meaning that it is a virtual asset that works on encryption systems to control production of units and verify the funds transfer. Bitcoin's operation is independent of central bank and can be used as a decentralized medium of exchange. Being an emerging domain, the blockchain systems on which these cryptocurrencies are based, are a great source of investment among enthusiasts. However, there is high volatility in the price of Bitcoin and thus it paves the way for its prediction so as to get a clear insight on its trend. Forecasting Bitcoin prices can provide valuable insights for investment portfolio management, risk assessment, and the identification of profitable trading or arbitrage opportunities. Furthermore, Bitcoin price predictions may assist firms that accept Bitcoin payments in enhancing their financial management practices by improving their revenue and cash flow forecasting. Additionally, governmental entities and regulatory bodies could leverage Bitcoin price forecasting as a tool for monitoring and regulating the cryptocurrency industry. This paper explores the effectiveness of ML models in predicting Bitcoin price by analyzing a diverse set of historical data. We evaluate several ML algorithms, and compare their performance in terms of accuracy to find out best algorithms for short term and long-term Bitcoin price prediction. © 2023 IEEE.},

In this paper, the authors develop a non-recurrent active trading algorithm based on stock price prediction, using Support Vector Machines on high frequency data, and compare its risk adjusted performance to the returns of a statistical portfolio predicted by the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The authors selected the three highest volume securities from a pool of 100 initially selected stock dataset to investigate the algorithmic trading strategy. The abnormal return estimates are significant and positive, and the systematic risk is lower than unity in all cases, suggesting lower risk compared to the market. Moreover, the estimated beta values for all stocks were close to zero, indicating a market independent process. The correlation analysis revealed weak correlations among the processes, supporting the potential for risk reduction and volatility mitigation through portfolio diversification. The authors tested an equally weighted portfolio of the selected three assets and demonstrated a remarkable return of 1348% during the evaluation period from July 1st, 2020, to January 1st, 2023. The results suggest that the weak form of market efficiency can be questioned, as the algorithmic trading strategy, employing a Support Vector Machine binary classification model, has consistently generated statistically significant and substantial abnormal returns using historical market data. © 2023, Polish Association for Knowledge Promotion.

	abstract = {With the development of deep learning, Dynamic Portfolio Optimization (DPO) problem has received a lot of attention in recent years, not only in the field of finance but also in the field of deep learning. Some advanced research in recent years has proposed the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to the DPO problem, which demonstrated to be more advantageous than supervised learning in solving the DPO problem. However, there are still certain unsolved issues: 1) DRL algorithms usually have the problems of slow learning speed and high sample complexity, which is especially problematic when dealing with complex financial data. 2) researchers use DRL simply for the purpose of obtaining high returns, but pay little attention to the problem of risk control and trading strategy, which will affect the stability of model returns. In order to address these issues, in this study we revamped the intrinsic structure of the model based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and proposed the Augmented DDPG model. Besides, we also proposed an innovative risk control strategy based on Quantum Price Levels (QPLs) derived from Quantum Finance Theory (QFT). Our experimental results revealed that our model has better profitability as well as risk control ability with less sample complexity in the DPO problem compared to the baseline models. © 2023 IEEE.},

The objective of the proposed minimization problem over the simplex contains three terms: negative expected return, transaction cost controlled term and regularization term for portfolio. Specifically, we use the elastic-net regularization of the difference between the portfolios of the next and the last periods to attack transaction costs. We additionally apply the elastic-net regularization to the portfolio variable, which due to the simplex constraint reduces to the square of the L2 norm of the variable, in order to improve the generalization of the model. We solve the proposed model by linearized augmented Lagrangian method, and its convergence is proved mathematically. Further, we obtain closed-form solutions of subproblem in each iteration, which increase the algorithm's efficiency. Numerical experiments on four benchmark data-sets demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the compared state-of-the-art algorithms in most case in a higher efficiency. © 2023 IEEE.},

Adaptive investment strategies which consider the dynamic market characteristics of individual assets and asset classes are vital for maximizing returns and minimizing risks. We introduce HADAPS, a novel computational method for multi-asset portfolio selection which utilizes the Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) framework enhanced with Hierarchical Policy Network. Contrary to previous approaches that have relied on heuristics for constructing asset allocations, HADAPSdirectly outputs a continuous vector of action values depending on current market conditions. In addition, HADAPS performs multi-asset portfolio selection involving multiple asset classes. Experimental results show that HADAPS outperforms baseline approaches in not only cumulative returns but also risk-adjusted metrics. These results are based on market price data from sectors with various behavioral characteristics. Furthermore, qualitative analysis shows HADAPS ' ability to adaptively shift portfolio selection strategies in dynamic market conditions where asset classes and different assets are uncorrelated to each other. © 2013 IEEE.},

We also show how to learn the risk-tolerance parameter and the degree of robustness directly from data. End-to-end systems have an advantage in that information can be communicated between the prediction and decision layers during training, allowing the parameters to be trained for the final task rather than solely for predictive performance. However, existing end-to-end systems are not able to quantify and correct for the impact of model risk on the decision layer. Our proposed distributionally robust end-to-end portfolio selection system explicitly accounts for the impact of model risk. The decision layer chooses portfolios by solving a minimax problem where the distribution of the asset returns is assumed to belong to an ambiguity set centered around a nominal distribution. Using convex duality, we recast the minimax problem in a form that allows for efficient training of the end-to-end system. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Under the criterion of expected exponential utility maximization, we obtain the optimal strategy in closed-form through the dynamic programming principle approach. Furthermore, numerical simulations are conducted by the Monte Carlo method to discuss the impacts of some parameters on the derived optimal strategy and to compare the optimal strategy with the suboptimal strategy when ignoring learning. It turns out that neglecting learning affects the optimal strategy seriously, thereby leading to significant utility losses. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Reinforcement learning (RL), a mathematical framework for sequential decision-making, is widely used in many financial decision-making problems, such as portfolio optimization, optimal execution, and market making. However, RL methods require a manual design of the reward function, which can be challenging in noisy market environments. Moreover, in such environments, it is often easier to demonstrate the desired behavior rather than manually engineer it. These problems can be solved using imitation learning (IL) algorithms, which extract knowledge from expert demonstrations by directly imitating the desired behavior or learning the expert's reward function. This paper introduces the foundational methods in IL, out-lines the differences with familiar frameworks, and provides a survey of the current IL applications in finance. © 2023 MIPRO Croatian Society.},

Various techniques have been proposed in the literature ranging from technical indicator-based methods to statistical methods and machine learning for portfolio optimization. However, there has been lack of effort to find the impact of machine learning along with technical indicators to build optimal stock portfolios for trading. From this line of research, this paper focusses on the use of deep learning-based LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) models along with Ichimoku cloud indicators to build optimal portfolios, which can be used in a practical stock market environment. This model is developed with combining the above prediction models such as LSTM and Ichimoku Cloud Indicators with Modern Portfolio Theory and Sharpe Ratio to optimize the model by reducing the risk to reward ratio. The model is tested with real life data of London Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange. By doing extensive experimental analysis, it was found that, the model combining LSTM network and Ichimoku Indicator, paired with Modern Portfolio Theory and Sharpe Ratio giving consistent performance in the market despite volatility.  © 2023 IEEE.},

We show that if NN strategies are evaluated using the holdout (train–test split) technique, then high out-of-sample performance scores can commonly be achieved. Although this phenomenon is often employed to validate NN portfolio models, we demonstrate that it constitutes a “fata morgana” that arises due to a particular vulnerability of portfolio optimization to overfitting. To assess whether overfitting is present, we set up a dedicated methodology based on combinatorially symmetric cross-validation that involves performance measurement across different holdout periods and varying portfolio compositions (the random-asset-stabilized combinatorially symmetric cross-validation methodology). We compare a variety of NN strategies with classical extensions of the mean–variance model and the 1/N strategy. We find that it is by no means trivial to outperform the classical models. While certain NN strategies outperform the 1/N benchmark, of the almost 30 models that we evaluate explicitly, none is consistently better than the short-sale constrained minimum-variance rule in terms of the Sharpe ratio or the certainty equivalent of returns. © 2023 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited},

However, achieving success in investing heavily relies on effective decision-making skills, which can be particularly challenging for newcomers. To tackle this issue, the research proposes an investment decision support system designed to aid investors in optimizing their investment portfolios. The proposed approach integrates traditional mathematical methods with advanced Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning techniques. The study demonstrates that the most effective combination involves employing LSTM alongside Post Modern Portfolio Theory (PMPT), resulting in the highest Mean Return of 0.002854, the highest Sortino Ratio of 0.192646, and the highest Ending Equity of 499.973204. Backtesting also reveals that the LSTM prediction, in combination with MPT and PMPT, has the potential to significantly increase portfolio values in just 1 year and 7 months, reaching 500% of the initial investment. Furthermore, incorporating LSTM predictions for future investment instrument prices enhances the performance of existing mathematical methods.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Optimizing stock portfolios is one of the ultimate objectives of rational investors. This objective is achieved by identifying the stocks that are expected to perform well in future and then making decisions to allocate funds amongst them in order to create the optimal investment portfolio. In the past, this optimization problem was addressed with the help of different statistical tools that were static and limited. Due to technological advancements, the implementation of machine learning methods in this field has become increasingly popular, enabling researchers to solve complex and nonstationary problems. There have been many recent studies that have integrated hyperparameters tuning kernels with these algorithms and combined modified-assets-selection-models to improve portfolio optimization results. Therefore, this paper provides a focused literature review on implementing machine learning in optimizing stock portfolios for the years between 2019 and 2022, and Google scholar was used to search for the relevant studies from Q1 or Q2 journals. This review revealed that Long short-term memory model was the most applied machine learning algorithm in predicting stocks returns. Moreover, it was found that Markowitz mean-variance model (classic and modified) was the most adopted approach for portfolio optimization. Based on the literature review, future insights are highlighted, and opportunities for further research are identified. © 2023 IEEE.},

To capture the momentum spillovers of listed firms, recent pilot studies have been studying graph neural networks to lead the influence propagation among listed firms and predict stock movement. However, all these works ignored the hysteresis effect of momentum spillover where the future return of a target firm lags behind the historical momentum spillovers which would cause hysteresis influence. In this study, we argue that the hysteresis effect of momentum spillover is critical in asset pricing and propose a novel hysteresis spatial-temporal graph learning (HysGL) for it. For spatial learning, we dynamically estimate the momentum spillover generated at each moment to represent the influence propagated from changing relevant firms. For temporal learning, we progressively propose the time-sensitive and state-sensitive mechanisms to explicitly model the influence pattern of hysteresis effect by calculating the response strength of a target firm to all historical momentum spillovers over the time dimension, based on which the cumulative hysteresis influence received by the target firm is obtained and then sequentially embedded to extract the hidden state preserving the temporal dependency of momentum spillovers. Extensive experiments performed on two real-world financial datasets demonstrate the superiority of the HysGL over the state-of-the-art algorithms, including TGC, FinGAT and AD-GAT.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Case overview/synopsis: The Chikankari art form gained worldwide recognition. In fact, it also received a geographical indication (GI) tag which is important for international branding. The case is centred around an entrepreneur, Mr. Vinod Punjabi, who redefined the essence of the existing Chikan art form by value addition in terms of intricate designs, patterns and exclusivity. He founded the brand Ada in 2015 aimed at preserving the traditional art form while curating elegance and exclusivity in its product portfolio. The case outlined Punjabi’s journey. The protagonist carefully analysed the open and unorganized Chikankari market and adopted the strategy of brand differentiation to stand apart from the competitors. Punjabi’s daughter, the chief operations officer of Ada, described the aspects. The journey was arduous, but over the years, Ada emerged as a successful name in the Chikankari market. The brand’s intent of becoming synonymous with Chikankari was successful owing to its authentic and exclusive hand-crafted products in the competitive environment of machine-made replicas. Furthermore, the brand also consistently worked on the aesthetic appearance of its store to attract a wide range of customers. Punjabi ensured that the brand was an amalgamation of all the essential elements for its survival in the long run.

A common approach to tackle these problems is to use constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) methods, which may suffer from sample inefficiency, hyperparameter tuning, and lack of guarantees for constraint violations. In this paper, we propose Action Space Decomposition Based Optimization (ADBO) for optimizing a more straightforward surrogate task that allows actions to be mapped back to the original task. We examine our method on two real-world data portfolio construction tasks. The results show that our new approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark approaches for general CMDPs. © 2023, The Author(s).},

An iterative method is widely used in the transaction model, nevertheless its running time is not guaranteed. Also, debt-based assets which are commonly non-publicly traded, seem to be overlooked, and the difference between trading days and calendar days is usually ignored. These deficiencies limit the scope and depth of applying RL methods to the finance field. In this work, a cash flow based framework is proposed to deal with these issues. A modified algorithm with guaranteed running time is proposed for the transaction model during portfolio rebalancing. With the effect of debts being considered, this framework can be used to solve asset-liability management problems including optimizing financial portfolios. The PPO algorithm is also extended, adapted to a more general value function form which uses time-variant discount rates. The experiments include a toy example and a more complicated problem with real-world data. The theoretic discussion and the positive experiment results demonstrate that the cash flow based framework could work. © 2023 IEEE.},

This is achieved by integrating uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for supervised learning into the ambiguity sets for distributionally robust optimisation (DRO). The pipelines leverage learning to produce contextual/conditional ambiguity sets from side-information. The two pipelines correspond to different UQ approaches: i) explicitly predicting the conditional covariance matrix using deep ensembles (DEs) and Gaussian processes (GPs), and ii) sampling using Monte Carlo dropout, DEs, and GPs. We use i) to construct an ambiguity set by defining an uncertainty around the estimated moments to achieve robustness with respect to the prediction model. UQ ii) is used as an empirical reference distribution of a Wasserstein ball to enhance out of sample performance. DRO problems constrained with either ambiguity set are tractable for a range of convex optimisation problems. We propose data-driven ways of setting DRO robustness parameters motivated by either coverage or out of sample performance. These parameters provide a useful yardstick in comparing the quality of UQ between prediction models. The pipelines are computationally evaluated and compared with deterministic and unconditional approaches on simulated and real-world portfolio optimisation problems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Machine learning and deep learning significantly have contributed to the development of AI in recent years. AI was proposed in 1950 but due to the limitations of hardware and low computational efficiency, it gradually was introduced in the 1980s. However, the advancement of hardware, the considerable improvement in computer processing speed, the learning ability, and the efficiency of machine learning have led to fast growth surpassing human ability in many fields. Machine learning can find the logical relationships between explanatory and explained variables in large amounts of data. Therefore, the financial market is suitable for the application of machine learning. Current applications of machine learning in the financial industry include predicting bond defaults, suspicious transaction forecasting, analyzing suitable loan amounts, predicting and recommending suitable investment suggestions for customers, and investment. Based on this, using historical data such as the trading volume, return, turnover, price-book ratio, price-to-sales ratio, and a price earning ratio of the constituent stocks of the CSI 300 Index, and employing the random forest algorithm in machine learning, we established an investment portfolio strategy for stocks to predict the future price increase and probability of an increase.

The results show that the causal relationship between Bitcoin and other financial assets varies depending on the market states. During the low volatility periods, Bitcoin has a stronger impact on the GSCI, while during the stability periods, it has a direct effect on the US index and the MSCI world index. In contrast, during high volatility periods, Bitcoin has a direct impact on both the GSCI and PIMCO indices. The key findings enabled us to provide implications for US investors to promote asset allocation and risk management covering both Bitcoin and traditional financial markets.

	abstract = {Success in optimising AI-related solutions has been greatly enhanced by the use of deep learning (AI). The stock market, trade execution tactics, and portfolio optimization are just some of the financial applications that make heavy use of this tool. A major use in this field is stock market forecasting. There has been a rise in the importance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) equipped with sophisticated AI models. In computer vision, however, it is employed for translating images. Setting the appropriate hyperparameters for a GAN makes it impractical to utilise for stock market prediction. The authors propose using a combination of Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning to solve this issue. Stock-GAN is a generator and discriminator that are part of a GAN-based deep learning architecture. LSTM is a recurrent NN, while CNNs are used to implement the latter (RNN). The Hybrid Prediction Algorithm is a new approach to prediction that is based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) (HPA). To predict stock prices, an empirical study found that Stock-GAN was more effective than the current state-of-the-art model; Multi-Model based Hybrid Prediction Algorithm (MM-HPA). After then, MM-HPA and GAN-HPA were fused to develop a new hybrid model called MMGAN-HPA, which has superior performance than both of its parent models.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Existing machine learning methods are effective in portfolio optimization on a small pool of assets. This is still not optimal because a larger number of assets in markets offers more opportunities for investors. However, existing methods are usually not scalable to large amount of assets which brings new challenges of high dimensionality and computing complexity. In this paper, we present a neural network temporal factor analysis (NN-TFA) model for dimensionality reduction and it enables us to build a scalable deep reinforcement learning method for large-scale portfolio management. Traditional TFA models the relation between asset prices and real economic activities via a small set of independent hidden factors. NN-TFA is developed from the traditional TFA by replacing the linear autoregressive model over the hidden factors with a neural network function, which well captures the complicated temporal patterns. The hidden factors are then sent to a policy network to generate portfolio weights. A calibration module to extract information from other assets features and a ratio module to catch the trend of the selected assets pool are proposed to enhance the performance of the policy network. Extensive tests demonstrate that our methods are capable of handling large-scale datasets and achieving promising results. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There are 1641 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India. It is undoubtedly infeasible for a retail investor to invest in all the stocks. It is a well-known fact that the portfolio's return is an average return of all its constituent stocks, and risk will be less than or equal to the maximum risk of all the portfolio components. This paper is unique as it elaborates on the entire portfolio selection, optimization, and management process. Portfolio selection is accomplished through the K-Means algorithm. Optimization is achieved utilizing the genetic algorithm, and a sliding window is applied for portfolio management. Four different ways of portfolio calculation, namely, equally-weighted portfolio, global minimum variance portfolio, market cap-weighted portfolio, and maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio, are applied. The results depict that all three optimized portfolios outperform the Nifty index. The dataset for the study is obtained from globaldatafeeds.in.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Portfolio selection is among the most challenging processes that have recently increased the interest of professionals in the area. The goal of mean-variance portfolio selection is to maximize expected return with minimizing risk. The Markowitz model was employed to solve the linear portfolio selection problem (PSP). However, due to numerous constraints and complexities, the problem is so critical that traditional models are insufficient to provide efficient solutions. Teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO) is a powerful population-based nature-inspired approach to solve optimization problems. This article presents a portfolio selection model using the TLBO approach to maximize the portfolio's Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio combines both expected return and risk. This algorithm models the natural teaching process of the classroom with two main phases, viz., teaching and learning. Performance analysis has been undertaken to investigate the suitability of TLBO based solution approach by comparing it with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) on the real datasets, Deutscher Aktienindex (DAX) 100, Hang Seng 31, standard & poor’s (S&P) 100, financial times stock exchange (FTSE) 100, and Nikkei 225. The empirical results verify the superiority of the TLBO over GA and PSO. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we apply SSL to extract features from financial time series data, and use those features to measure the similarities between assets in the market. As similarity measurement is the key to portfolio diversification, we consider two portfolio optimisation problems: index tracking (IT) and minimum variance portfolio (MVP), with the additional diversification terms linked to different similarity measurements, which are sourced from different SSL algorithms. Both IT and MVP are both convex optimisation problems with deterministic solutions, therefore the performance difference is traced back to SSL algorithms, rather than other factors. Extensive experiments are conducted with eight SSL algorithms, and the analysis of the results of the experiments demonstrates the advantages of SSL over non-SSL alternatives. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Emerging technologies and tools offer new ways to deal with existing problems. With the help of clustering, similarities between product variants can be identified automatically, and complexity can be systematically reduced. This article aims to develop a methodological approach to identify correlations between product variants in complex product portfolios automatically by using clustering algorithms. The approach includes the systematic cleaning and transformation of product portfolio data. In addition, a guide for algorithm selection and evaluation of clustering results is presented. As the last step, the results are systematically analysed and visualised. To validate the methodical approach, it is applied to a real-world data set of a commercial vehicle manufacturer and the usefulness of the results is confirmed in an expert workshop. © The Author(s), 2023.

	abstract = {The financing difficulty of SMEs has a long history. Most SMEs are in the start-up and growth stages, and are often in a weak position in the supply chain. However, the core enterprises with strong competitiveness and large scale are relatively strong against SMEs in the upstream and downstream of their supply chain, which is mainly reflected in the core enterprises' superior bargaining power and cash holdings. At present, all kinds of risk analysis models in the financial market are mainly considered from the perspective of economics and random uncertainty. However, there are many fuzzy concepts without clear extension in the financial system, and the traditional mathematical methods cannot describe the fuzzy uncertainty phenomenon. Therefore, financial risk prevention has become one of the core tasks in the management of industrial and commercial enterprises and financial institutions. Scientific investment portfolio optimization decision-making is of great practical significance for effectively controlling financial risks and optimizing resource allocation. Based on this background, this paper applies association rule algorithm in data mining to predict financial risks, and puts forward relevant countermeasures and suggestions, hoping to contribute to China's financial risks and related research, and promote the globalization development of Chinese enterprises.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Portfolio theory underpins portfolio management, a much-researched yet uncharted field. This research suggests a collective framework combined with the essence of deep learning for stock selection through prediction and optimal portfolio formation through the mean-variance (MV) model. The CNN-LSTM model, proposed in Stage I blends the benefits of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long-short-term memory network (LSTM). The model combines feature extraction and sequential learning about temporal data fluctuations. The experiment considers thirteen input features, combining fundamental market data and technical indicators to capture the nuances of the wildly fluctuating stock market data. The input data sample of 21 stocks was collected from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India from January 2005 to December 2021, spanning two significant market crashes. Thus, the sample makes it possible to catch subtle market shifts for model execution. The shortlisted stocks with high potential returns are advanced to Stage II for optimal stock allocation using the MV model. The proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM outperformed the single models, i.e., CNN and LSTM, per the six-performance metrics and advocated by the 10-fold cross-validation technique. Furthermore, the statistical significance of the model is established using non-parametric tests followed by post hoc analysis. In addition, this method is validated by comparing the proposed model to four baseline strategies and relevant pieces of research, which it considerably outperforms in terms of cumulative return per year, Sharpe ratio, and average return to risk with and without transaction cost. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM approach in stock selection and portfolio optimization. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The task of portfolio management is the selection of portfolio allocations for every single time step during an investment period while adjusting the risk-return profile of the portfolio to the investor’s individual level of risk preference. In practice, it can be hard for an investor to quantify his individual risk preference. As an alternative, approximating the risk-return Pareto front allows for the comparison of different optimized portfolio allocations and hence for the selection of the most suitable risk level. Furthermore, an approximation of the Pareto front allows the analysis of the overall risk sensitivity of various investment policies. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) based approach, in which a single meta agent generates optimized portfolio allocation policies for any level of risk preference in a given interval. Our method is more efficient than previous approaches, as it only requires training of a single agent for the full approximate risk-return Pareto front. Additionally, it is more stable in training and only requires per time step market risk estimations independent of the policy. Such risk control per time step is a common regulatory requirement for e.g., insurance companies. We benchmark our meta agent against other state-of-the-art risk-aware RL methods using a realistic environment based on real-world Nasdaq-100 data. Our evaluation shows that the proposed meta agent outperforms various benchmark approaches by generating strategies with better risk-return profiles. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The noisiness and non-stationarity of asset returns makes the estimation of risk premia using machine learning (ML) techniques challenging. In this work, we develop ML models that solve the problems associated with risk premia forecasting by separating risk premia prediction into two independent tasks, a time series model and a cross-sectional model, and using neural networks with skip connections to enable their deep neural network training. These models are tested robustly with different metrics, and we observe that our models outperform several existing standard ML models. A known issue with ML models is their ‘black box’ nature, i.e. their opaqueness to interpretability. We interpret these deep neural networks using local approximation-based techniques that provide explanations for our model's predictions. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {To improve the marketing activity and brand management and justify the most effective marketing decisions, organizations should implement different information technologies, mathematical methods and models into the marketing decision support system (MDSS). The goal of this paper is to form an architecture of an MDSS, the model base of which is developed on Data Science tools, in particular regression analysis and machine learning methods. The proposed MDSS is a multi-agent information system comprising nine intellectual agents (market environment monitoring, data processing, marketing mix modeling, price policy support, portfolio management, strategic analysis, forecasting, customer segmentation, and customer classification). The functionality of these agents is realized through Data Science, which allows for the optimization of marketing activities (e.g., an effective brand management strategy and its elements (portfolio strategy, price policy, and media strategy) or solving the problems of attracting new and retaining current customers with the maximal return on marketing investments). The MDSS analyzes the marketing environment, media activity, and business indicators by constructing different models and forecasting various combinations of marketing factors to select the best one. The joint work of MDSS agents provides decision-makers with interactive reports. The research findings offer a scientific basis for making effective marketing decisions based on data, and the proposed MDSS can become part of an intelligent system for planning marketing activities. © Galyna Chornous, Yana Fareniuk, Vincentas Rolandas Giedraitis, Erstida Ulvidienė, Ganna Kharlamova, 2023.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to introduce a new perspective on long-term stock return predictability by focusing on the relative (individual and hybrid) informative power of a wide range of accounting (firm-related), technical and macroeconomic factors while considering the past performance of the stocks using machine learning algorithms. Design/methodology/approach: The sample includes a panel data set of 94 non-financial firms listed in Egyptian Exchange 100 index from 2014: Q1 to 2019: Q4. Relativity has been investigated by comparing relevant factors’ individual and combined informative power and differentiating between losers and winners based on historical stock returns. To predict the quarterly stock returns, Gaussian process regression (GPR) has been used. The robustness of the results is examined through the out-of-sample test. This study also uses linear regression (LR) as a benchmark model. Findings: The past performance and the presence of other predictors influence the informative power of relevant factors and hence their predictive ability. The out-of-sample results show a trade-off between GPR and LR with proven superiority to GPR in limited experiments. The individual informative power outperforms the hybrid power, in which macroeconomic indicators outperform the remaining sets of indicators for losers, while winners show mixed results in terms of various performance evaluation metrics. Prediction accuracy is generally higher for losers than for winners. Practical implications: This study provides interesting insight into the dynamic nature of the predictor variables in terms of stock return predictability. Hence, this study also deepens the understanding of asset pricing in a way that directly contributes to practitioners’ portfolio diversification strategies. Originality/value: In concern of the chaos of factors in the literature and its accompanying misleading conclusions, this study takes another look at the approach that studies stock return predictability. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study in the Egyptian context that re-examines the predictive power of the previously discovered factors from a different perspective that highlights their relative nature. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We test the different approaches via a recursive out-of-sample exercise on daily data from the 1st of January 2011 up until the 15th of March 2021. The investment set contains the sectoral decomposition of the SP500 plus the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate index. We find that including higher moments into the objective function helps improving performances, albeit the minimum-variance strategy combined with the Deep Dynamic Factor Model of Andreini et al. (2020) outperforms all the other methods over the sample analysed and in terms of the risk-adjusted metrics considered. We conclude this chapter by carrying out an analysis of the relation between the excess returns generated by selected strategies, and standard financial factors. We do so both by using linear regression methods and deep learning techniques together with Shapley values. © 2023 Fondazione Gerardo Capriglione Onlus. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We analyze dynamic investment strategies for benchmark outperformance using two widely used objectives of practical interest to investors: (i) maximizing the information ratio (IR), and (ii) obtaining a favorable tracking difference (cumulative outperformance) relative to the benchmark. In the case of the tracking difference, we propose a simple and intuitive objective function based on the quadratic deviation (QD) from an elevated benchmark. In order to gain some intuition about these strategies, we provide closed-form solutions for the controls under idealized assumptions. For more realistic cases, we represent the control using a neural network (NN) and directly solve a sampled optimization problem, which approximates the original optimal stochastic control formulation. Unlike the typical approach based on dynamic programming (DP), e.g., reinforcement learning, solving the sampled optimization with an NN as a control avoids computing conditional expectations and leads to an optimization problem with a small number of variables. In addition, our NN parameter size is independent of the number of portfolio rebalancing times. Under some assumptions, we prove that a traditional DP approach results in a high-dimensional problem, whereas directly solving for the control without using DP yields a low-dimensional problem. Our analytical and numerical results illustrate that, compared with IR-optimal strategies with the same expected value of terminal wealth, the QD-optimal investment strategies result in comparatively more diversified asset allocations during certain periods of the investment time horizon. © 2023 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications.

Traditional models, notably the Black-Scholes, often encounter challenges in comprehensively integrating the multifaceted interplay of contemporary market variables. Addressing this lacuna, this study elucidates the capabilities of a novel Deep Residual Convolution Long Short-term Memory (DR-CLSTM) network, meticulously designed to amalgamate the superior feature extraction prowess of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the unparalleled temporal sequence discernment of Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks, further augmented by deep residual connections. Rigorous evaluations conducted on an expansive dataset, representative of diverse market conditions, showcased the DR-CLSTM's consistent supremacy in prediction accuracy and computational efficacy over both its traditional and deep learning contemporaries. Crucially, the integration of residual pathways accelerated training convergence rates and provided a formidable defense against the often detrimental vanishing gradient phenomenon. Consequently, this research positions the DR-CLSTM network as a pioneering and formidable contender in the arena of option price forecasting, offering substantive implications for quantitative finance scholars and practitioners alike, and hinting at its potential versatility for broader financial instrument applications and varied market scenarios. © (2023), (Science and Information Organization).

	abstract = {Asset pricing revolves around determining the theoretical value of an asset (stock) by evaluating a wide range of influence factors. High-dimensional data poses extraordinary challenges to asset pricing research as it results in a low signal-to-noise ratio environment that affects the computation of risk premia. Over the years data-driven solutions to the problems of empirical asset pricing have been found by developing a close bond with machine learning techniques. In practical applications, the use of dimensionality reduction techniques such as Statistical Factor Models exploit the concept of low dimensional spaces accounting for most of the variation in high dimensional data. This work explores the use of Statistical Factor Models based on conventional Principal Components Analysis and a novel Maximum Likelihood Estimation - computed numerically with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm using a centroid initialization method for smoother convergence. On comparing the implementations for 3 and 5 factors across various sample sizes, it was noted that that the proposed Maximum Likelihood Estimation based model outperforms the conventional Principal Components based factor model with a lower average mean deviation in L2 norm value for factor loadings.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The primary objective of this research is to provide a precise interpretation of the constructed machine learning model and produce definitive summaries that can evaluate the influence of investor sentiment on the overall sales of non-fungible token (NFT) assets. To achieve this objective, the NFT hype index was constructed as well as several approaches of XAI were employed to interpret Black Box models and assess the magnitude and direction of the impact of the features used. Design/methodology/approach: The research paper involved the construction of a sentiment index termed the NFT hype index, which aims to measure the influence of market actors within the NFT industry. This index was created by analyzing written content posted by 62 high-profile individuals and opinion leaders on the social media platform Twitter. The authors collected posts from the Twitter accounts that were afterward classified by tonality with a help of natural language processing model VADER. Then the machine learning methods and XAI approaches (feature importance, permutation importance and SHAP) were applied to explain the obtained results. Findings: The built index was subjected to rigorous analysis using the gradient boosting regressor model and explainable AI techniques, which confirmed its significant explanatory power. Remarkably, the NFT hype index exhibited a higher degree of predictive accuracy compared to the well-known sentiment indices. Practical implications: The NFT hype index, constructed from Twitter textual data, functions as an innovative, sentiment-based indicator for investment decision-making in the NFT market. It offers investors unique insights into the market sentiment that can be used alongside conventional financial analysis techniques to enhance risk management, portfolio optimization and overall investment outcomes within the rapidly evolving NFT ecosystem. Thus, the index plays a crucial role in facilitating well-informed, data-driven investment decisions and ensuring a competitive edge in the digital assets market. Originality/value: The authors developed a novel index of investor interest for NFT assets (NFT hype index) based on text messages posted by market influencers and compared it to conventional sentiment indices in terms of their explanatory power. With the application of explainable AI, it was shown that sentiment indices may perform as significant predictors for NFT sales and that the NFT hype index works best among all sentiment indices considered. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Deep learning (DL) is a new and relatively unexplored field that finds immense applications in many industries, especially ones that must make detailed observations, inferences and predictions based on extensive and scattered datasets. The purpose of this paper is to answer the following questions: (1) To what extent has DL penetrated the research being done in finance? (2) What areas of financial research have applications of DL, and what quality of work has been done in the niches? (3) What areas still need to be explored and have scope for future research? Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs bibliometric analysis, a potent yet simple methodology with numerous applications in literature reviews. This paper focuses on citation analysis, author impacts, relevant and vital journals, co-citation analysis, bibliometric coupling and co-occurrence analysis. The authors collected 693 articles published in 2000–2022 from journals indexed in the Scopus database. Multiple software (VOSviewer, RStudio (biblioshiny) and Excel) were employed to analyze the data. Findings: The findings reveal significant and renowned authors' impact in the field. The analysis indicated that the application of DL in finance has been on an upward track since 2017. The authors find four broad research areas (neural networks and stock market simulations; portfolio optimization and risk management; time series analysis and forecasting; high-frequency trading) with different degrees of intertwining and emerging research topics with the application of DL in finance. This article contributes to the literature by providing a systematic overview of the DL developments, trajectories, objectives and potential future research topics in finance. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this paper act as a guide for literature review for anyone interested in doing research in the intersection of finance and DL. The article also explores multiple areas of research that have yet to be studied to a great extent and have abundant scope. Originality/value: Very few studies have explored the applications of machine learning (ML), namely, DL in finance, which is a much more specialized subset of ML. The authors look at the problem from the aspect of different techniques in DL that have been used in finance. This is the first qualitative (content analysis) and quantitative (bibliometric analysis) assessment of current research on DL in finance. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It offers several benefits, including handling complex datasets, recognizing and predicting patterns, adaptability and scalability, automating trading strategies, risk management and portfolio optimization, and more. However, it's important to recognize that stock markets are influenced by numerous unpredictable factors, and there are inherent limitations and uncertainties in predicting market movements. Therefore, machine learning should be utilized as one tool among many in the investor's decision-making process, complementing human judgment and domain expertise. This survey article explores the use of machine learning techniques in stock market price prediction, examining different models and their success rates across various countries and datasets. It also delves into the commonly used data sources for stock price prediction and discusses methods for processing this data.

	abstract = {As an alternate form of trade money, cryptocurrencies are now widely accepted and have been integrated into all financial activities. Trading cryptocurrencies is one of the most popular and promising forms of investing. However, the cryptocurrency markets are notorious for their tremendous volatility and price discrepancies over short periods. To ensure accurate and trustworthy predictions, it is necessary to have an automated trading model that includes portfolio management and optimization. Automated algorithmic trading uses computers to carry out trades in accordance with the past and predicted trends following a defined set of rules. These rules include trading instructions based on time, value, quantity, or any other mathematical model of trading. Profits may be achieved through algorithmic trading at inhumanely high speeds and frequencies. In addition to providing profitable trading opportunities, algorithmic trading increases market fluidity and increases trading accuracy by reducing human elements such as emotions and feelings regarding the trade. This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing market revolution by discussing the various aspects of cryptocurrecy trading, its forecasting and actual development of an algorithmic trading bot that will implement client strategies closely accompanied by its own calculations for daily exchanges based on economic conditions and client approaches. It will also contribute to and exchange with ongoing adjustments throughout the day to ensure the best profitability of the clients. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization is defined as the process of asset allocation to achieve optimum expected returns and/or minimizing financial risk associated. It is crucial for a financial risk manager to provide the best returns possible in the market and calculation of risks like value-at-risk. The problem of portfolio optimization is not new to the financial world, and approaches like efficient frontier are already known. While the work on optimization of portfolio is voluminous, this paper describes the portfolio optimization approach using reinforcement learning. This approach is particularly useful in the case where the search space is very large, and distribution of assets must be done in real time. Algorithmic trading could be a good candidate for this optimization approach. In this paper, the description is given for a few famous optimization algorithms also that is used in the financial industry. The main idea of this RL (reinforcement learning)-based approach is that agent learns the weight distribution across the portfolio by rewarding and punishing the weight ratio and by continuously doing so it can produce real-time distribution of the weights. The study has been done on a portfolio of four stocks though can be extended to any number of stocks in the portfolio. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Empirical risk minimization (ERM) and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) are popular approaches for solving stochastic optimization problems that appear in operations management and machine learning. Existing generalization error bounds for these methods depend on either the complexity of the cost function or dimension of the uncertain parameters; consequently, the performance of these methods is poor for high-dimensional problems with objective functions under high complexity. We propose a simple approach in which the distribution of uncertain parameters is approximated using a parametric family of distributions. This mitigates both sources of complexity; however, it introduces a model misspecification error. We show that this new source of error can be controlled by suitable DRO formulations. Our proposed parametric DRO approach has significantly improved generalization bounds over existing ERM/DRO methods and parametric ERM for a wide variety of settings. Our method is particularly effective under distribution shifts. We also illustrate the superior performance of our approach on both synthetic and real-data portfolio optimization and regression tasks. Copyright © 2023 by the author(s)},

This paper proposes an effective algorithm based on neural networks to take advantage of these investment products. The proposed algorithm constructs a portfolio that contains a pair of negatively correlated assets. A deep neural network, which outputs the allocation weight of each asset at a time interval, is trained to maximize the Sharpe ratio. A novel loss term is proposed to regulate the network's bias towards a specific asset, thus enforcing the network to learn an allocation strategy that is close to a minimum variance strategy. Extensive experiments were conducted using data collected from Binance spanning 19 months to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The backtest results show that the proposed algorithm can produce neural networks that are able to make profits in different market situations. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Rational investors have a primary objective of optimizing their stock portfolios. Achieving this goal involves the selection of stocks that are projected to perform well in the future and determining how to allocate capital among them to create the ideal investment portfolio. To address this optimization challenge, various static and constrained statistical approaches have been employed. However, the application of machine learning techniques in this field has gained increasing popularity due to technological advancements, enabling researchers to tackle complex and nonstationary scenarios. Recent studies have integrated these algorithms with updated asset selection models and hyperparameter tuning kernels to enhance the performance of portfolio optimization. This research provides a focused literature review on the integration of machine learning with stock portfolio optimization. The analysis revealed that the most commonly utilized machine learning method for predicting stock returns was the long short-Term memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, the Markowitz mean-variance model emerged as the most popular approach for optimizing portfolio stock selection. The research also identifies potential avenues for future investigation and underscores the implications of the study's findings. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, reinforcement learning has been applied to cryptocurrencies to make profitable trades. However, cryptocurrency trading is a very challenging task due to the volatility of the market, especially during bearish periods. In addressing this problem, the existing literature employs single-agent techniques such as deep Q-network (DQN), advantage actor-critic (A2C), and proximal policy optimization (PPO), or their ensembles. Moreover, in the context of cryptocurrencies, the mechanisms for restricting losses during a bearish market are insufficiently robust. Consequently, the performance of reinforcement learning methods for cryptocurrency trading in the existing literature is constrained. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel cryptocurrency trading method based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with a collaborative multi-agent scheme and a local-global reward function to optimize both the individual and collective performance of the agents. Both a multi-objective optimization technique and a multi-scale continuous loss (MSCL) reward are used to train agents using a progressive penalty to avoid consecutive losses of portfolio value. For evaluation, we compared our method to multiple baselines. As a result, better cumulative returns are achieved than when baseline methods are used. In addition, the superiority of our method is emphasized by the result of the bearish test set, where only our method can make a profit. Specifically, our method obtains a 2.36% cumulative return, whereas the baseline methods result in negative cumulative returns. In comparison to FinRL-Ensemble, a reinforcement learning-based method, our method achieves a 46.05% greater cumulative return in the bullish test set. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose a portfolio management strategy based on the framework of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). To assess the effectiveness of our strategy, we compare DDPG using financial indicators with DDPG using only price as a feature, which simulate the best performance in the financial market. Experimentally, we select a set of stocks with low correlation and compare the accumulative portfolio value of our strategy with other strategies, including Uniform Buy and Hold, Exponential Gradient, and Universal Portfolios. Through experimentation, we find that our strategy outperforms most of the other strategies, with an accumulative portfolio value of 5.782. Furthermore, our strategy exhibits a Sharp Ratio of 2.064, which is only 5.2% lower than the best-performing strategy. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {In this interdisciplinary, conceptual article with implications in marketing financial products and services, we study real estate and capital markets characterized by a predatory paradigm and economic agents’ dark financial profiles (DFPs). These are estimated by three orthogonal components—disconnection, irrationality, and deceit. We identify the best interactional patterns of borrower-lender profiles, ones that expectedly minimize the risk of default. We resort to discretized, predator–prey Lotka–Volterra equations where lenders act as predators and borrowers as prey, incorporating market trends and learning effects. To mathematically operationalize our framework, we use combinatorics with high, medium, and low levels of the three components of DFPs. We find 27 salient lender-borrower interactional scenarios and observe three different patterns: explosive, conducive, and implosive. Our theoretical findings indicate that equal (ir)rationality (in financial terms) between lenders and borrowers is a necessary but insufficient condition to maintain harmonious, long-term relationships. We use eutectic theory to map the agents’ profiles by introducing another variable: Expected return [E(Rp)] versus risk [σ], using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) as a base. We find six market segments: the inactive predators and prey, the loose, the greedy, the vulnerable, and the stable. We identify the optimal combination of borrowers–lenders interaction under risk, given market trends and learning effects. We propose a path for future research that would see the application of analytical tools such as factor analysis, k-means clustering algorithm, χ 2 and non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparison tests to verify differences among the hypothesized segments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

This paper proposes an innovative algorithm to solve the optimal portfolio problem in stock market trading activities. Our novel portfolio trading strategy utilizes three features to outperform other benchmark strategies in a real-market environment. First, we propose a mean-VaR portfolio optimization model, the solution of which is based on the actor-critic architecture. Unlike the existing literature that learns the expectation of cumulative returns, the critic module learns the cumulative returns distribution by quantile regression, and the actor module outputs the optimal portfolio weight by maximizing the objective function of the optimization model. Secondly, we use a linear transformation function to realize short selling to ensure investors have profit opportunities in the bear market. Third, A multi-process method, called Ape-x, was used to accelerate the speed of deep reinforcement learning training. To validate our proposed approach, we conduct backtesting for two representative portfolios and observe that the proposed model in this work is superior to the benchmark strategies. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to examine from commodity portfolio managers’ perspective the performance of liquidity adjusted risk modeling in assessing the market risk parameters of a large commodity portfolio and in obtaining efficient and coherent portfolios under different market circumstances. Design/methodology/approach: The implemented market risk modeling algorithm and investment portfolio analytics using reinforcement machine learning techniques can simultaneously handle risk-return characteristics of commodity investments under regular and crisis market settings besides considering the particular effects of the time-varying liquidity constraints of the multiple-asset commodity portfolios. Findings: In particular, the paper implements a robust machine learning method to commodity optimal portfolio selection and within a liquidity-adjusted value-at-risk (LVaR) framework. In addition, the paper explains how the adapted LVaR modeling algorithms can be used by a commodity trading unit in a dynamic asset allocation framework for estimating risk exposure, assessing risk reduction alternates and creating efficient and coherent market portfolios. Originality/value: The optimization parameters subject to meaningful operational and financial constraints, investment portfolio analytics and empirical results can have important practical uses and applications for commodity portfolio managers particularly in the wake of the 2007–2009 global financial crisis. In addition, the recommended reinforcement machine learning optimization algorithms can aid in solving some real-world dilemmas under stressed and adverse market conditions (e.g. illiquidity, switching in correlations factors signs, nonlinear and non-normal distribution of assets’ returns) and can have key applications in machine learning, expert systems, smart financial functions, internet of things (IoT) and financial technology (FinTech) in big data ecosystems. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization is defined as the process of asset distribution to achieve optimum expected returns and/or minimizing financial risk associated. It is crucial for a financial risk manager to provide the best returns possible in the market and calculation of risks like value-at-risk. The problem of portfolio optimization is not new to the financial world, and approach like efficient frontier is already known. While the work on optimization of portfolio is voluminous, this paper describes the portfolio optimization approach using reinforcement learning. This approach is particularly useful in the case where the search space is very large, and distribution of asset must be done in real time. Algorithmic trading could be a good candidate for this optimization approach. In this paper, the description is given for a few famous optimization algorithms also that is used in the financial industry. The main idea of this reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach is that agent learns the weights distribution across the portfolio by rewarding and punishing the weights ratio and by continuously doing so it can produce real-time distribution of the weights. The study has been done on a portfolio of four stocks though can be extends to any number of stocks in the portfolio. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Joint university-industry laboratories (joint U-I labs) consist of a new, yet little understood model of academic partnership with the firms, typically involving the establishment of a collaborative research unit to conduct research and development (R&D) projects. This type of collaboration faces an ongoing challenge in dealing with the tension between the development and deployment focus in the project portfolio. While several studies have investigated project portfolio management in a given firm, little is known about the interorganizational portfolio management and how the actors manage tensions in joint U-I labs. This study aims to investigate the microfoundations of project portfolio management in joint U-I labs. By combining the multiple-case study and at-home ethnography methods, we identified that the regulation approach explains how partners in joint U-I labs dynamically adjust and manage the project portfolio. Based on the empirical findings, we propose a new framework for project portfolio management in joint U-I labs: portfolio regulation. This framework consists of four processes: dual scouting, dual matchmaking, joint selection, and bridgemaking. These microfoundations enable actors to strategically regulate the portfolio by increasing/decreasing resources related to development or deployment. Our study explores how portfolio regulation evolves within a joint U-I lab through four stages: formation, learning, reconfiguration, and joint portfolio. The proposed framework contributes to interorganizational R&D portfolio management theory and joint U-I lab portfolio management practice. © 2022},

	abstract = {New drug development guarantees a very high return on success, but the success rate is extremely low. Pharmaceutical companies have attempted to use various strategies to increase the success rate of drug development, but this goal has been difficult to achieve. In this study, we developed a model that can guide effective decision-making at the planning stage of new drug development by leveraging machine learning. The Drug Development Recommendation (DDR) model, we present here, is a hybrid model for recommending and/or predicting drug groups suitable for development by individual pharmaceutical companies. It combines association rule learning, collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering approaches for enterprise-customized recommendations. In the case of content-based filtering applying a random forest classification algorithm, the accuracy and area under curve were 78% and 0.74, respectively. In particular, the DDR model was applied to predict the success probability of companies developing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. It was demonstrated that the higher the predicted score from the DDR model, the more progress in the clinical phase of the COVID-19 vaccine development. Although our approach has limitations that should be improved, it makes scientific as well as industrial contributions in that the DDR model can support rational decision-making prior to initiating drug development by considering not only technical aspects but also company-related variables. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Financial trading is one of the most popular problems for reinforcement learning in recent years. One of the important challenges is that investment is a multi-objective problem. That is, professional investors do not act solely on expected profit but also carefully consider the potential risk of a given investment. To handle such a challenge, previous studies have explored various kinds of risk-sensitive rewards, for example, the Sharpe ratio as computed by a fixed length of previous returns. This work proposes a new approach to deal with the profit-to-risk tradeoff by applying distributional reinforcement learning to build a risk awareness policy instead of a simple risk-based reward function. Our new policy, termed C51-Sharpe, is to select the action based on the Sharpe ratio computed from the probability mass function of the return. This produces a significantly higher Sharpe ratio and lower maximum drawdown without sacrificing profit compared to the C51algorithm utilizing a purely profit-based policy. Moreover, it can outperform other benchmarks, such as a Deep Q-Network (DQN) with a Sharpe ratio reward function. Besides the policy, we also studied the effect of using double networks and the choice of exploration strategies with our approach to identify the optimal training configuration. We find that the epsilon-greedy policy is the most suitable exploration for C51-Sharpe and that the use of double network has no significant impact on performance. Our study provides statistical evidence of the efficiency in risk-sensitive policy implemented by using distributional reinforcement algorithms along with an optimized training process. © 2022, Chiang Mai University.

Moreover, long-only portfolios built from expected returns fit to these 87 factors using linear ridge and nonlinear machine learning models like gradient boosting generated larger and more statistically significant excess returns in nearly all countries. A long-only portfolio optimized to maximize return given an aversion to tracking error delivered yet higher excess returns and information ratios across countries.

	abstract = {The total capital in cryptocurrency markets is around two trillion dollars in 2022, which is almost the same as Apple’s market capitalisation at the same time. Increasingly, cryptocurrencies have become established in financial markets with an enormous number of transactions and trades happening every day. Similar to other financial systems, price prediction is one of the main challenges in cryptocurrency trading. Therefore, the application of artificial intelligence, as one of the tools of prediction, has emerged as a recently popular subject of investigation in the cryptocurrency domain. Since machine learning models, as opposed to traditional financial models, demonstrate satisfactory performance in quantitative finance, they seem ideal for coping with the price prediction problem in the complex and volatile cryptocurrency market. There have been several studies that have focused on applying machine learning for price and movement prediction and portfolio management in cryptocurrency markets, though these methods and models are in their early stages. This survey paper aims to review the current research trends in applications of supervised and reinforcement learning models in cryptocurrency price prediction. This study also highlights potential research gaps and possible areas for improvement. In addition, it emphasises potential challenges and research directions that will be of interest in the artificial intelligence and machine learning communities focusing on cryptocurrencies. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin (BTC)—the first cryptocurrency—is a decentralized network used to make private, anonymous, peer-to-peer transactions worldwide, yet there are numerous issues in its pricing due to its arbitrary nature, thus limiting its use due to skepticism among businesses and households. However, there is a vast scope of machine learning approaches to predict future prices precisely. One of the major problems with previous research on BTC price predictions is that they are primarily empirical research lacking sufficient analytical support to back up the claims. Therefore, this study aims to solve the BTC price prediction problem in the context of both macroeconomic and microeconomic theories by applying new machine learning methods. Previous work, however, shows mixed evidence of the superiority of machine learning over statistical analysis and vice versa, so more research is needed. This paper applies comparative approaches, including ordinary least squares (OLS), Ensemble learning, support vector regression (SVR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), to investigate whether the macroeconomic, microeconomic, technical, and blockchain indicators based on economic theories predict the BTC price or not. The findings point out that some technical indicators are significant short-run BTC price predictors, thus confirming the validity of technical analysis. Moreover, macroeconomic and blockchain indicators are found to be significant long-term predictors, implying that supply, demand, and cost-based pricing theories are the underlying theories of BTC price prediction. Likewise, SVR is found to be superior to other machine learning and traditional models. This research’s innovation is looking at BTC price prediction through theoretical aspects. The overall findings show that SVR is superior to other machine learning models and traditional models. This paper has several contributions. It can contribute to international finance to be used as a reference for setting asset pricing and improved investment decision-making. It also contributes to the economics of BTC price prediction by introducing its theoretical background. Moreover, as the authors still doubt whether machine learning can beat the traditional methods in BTC price prediction, this research contributes to machine learning configuration and helping developers use it as a benchmark. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Recent financial studies have shown that spillover effects of some market factors play a significant role in stock fluctuations. Previous studies, however, were incapable of capturing the spillovers of these relational market factors because they relied on a homogeneous graph that condenses these factors into firm node attributes and requires their spillover effects to follow firm relationship instead of themselves. This fact brings up a heterogeneous graph learning problem that requires multiple node types to transport different spillover effects. This study proposes a novel conditional heterogeneous graph neural network (FinHGNN) to capture multiple spillover effects in asset pricing with two uniquely designed mechanisms. First, it presents an efficient way to preserve the connectivity of relational attributes in graph learning, which is achieved by converting relational attributes into node variables to form a heterogeneous graph. Second, a conditional message-passing mechanism is proposed to handle multiple spillover effects simultaneously by messaging conditioned on different types of nodes and node attributes. This study paves the way for addressing the relational attributes in graph learning. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework over three classic and four state-of-the-art algorithms, including LSTM, GCN, HGNN, eLSTM, TGC, FinGAT, and AD-GAT. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

While practitioners may resort to various GARCH-type models for correlation forecasting, the forecasting accuracy is still not very satisfactory. For the first time, this paper introduces a deep learning method into the research of stock market correlation. A hybrid DCDNN model is developed based on the RDNN (recurrent deep neural network) and DCC-GARCH models. Deep learning is then devised to forecast the prediction error of the DCC-GARCH model in order to improve the prediction accuracy of stock market correlation. An autoencoder is also introduced in the empirical study to extract useful features of the stock index data. Then, the correlations among the stock markets in China, Hong Kong, the United States and Europe are predicted and tested. We show that the accuracy of the DCDNN model is significantly higher than that of the DCC-GARCH model. The results indicate that the introduction of deep learning can help improve the efficacy of existing correlation forecasting methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The decision-making on portfolio investment is fundamental in the financial market, but getting the optimal strategy is challenging due to high uncertainty and massive noise in the market. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), proposed by Lillicrap et al. (2015), is a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that made remarkable achievements in the financial perspective. Although the applications of RL in financial trading are well-developed, it is surprising that most of the literature ignores the possible risk of rare occurrences of catastrophic events and the effect of the worst-case scenarios on trading decisions. In this paper, we first develop a novel deep RL algorithm, called Hierarchical DDPG, that combines the classical DDPG algorithm and the Hierarchical RL structure to control the risk of portfolio investment. Second, we adapt the distributional DDPG method for portfolio management problems, which aims to maximize the α-percentile expectation based on the distribution of future returns. A real world dataset is used to validate the performance of our proposed models. The experimental results show that our proposed models outperform the market and classical DDPG, and moreover, both approaches provide effective methods of constructing a risk-sensitive policy to protect investors from suffering a huge loss. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {By using the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and prospect theory (PT) to model investors’ behavior-related decisions in portfolio optimization, we propose a novel dynamic behavior-based sparse portfolio selection model (BPSM) operating over multiple periods. With the BPSM model, we complement recent research that involves only investors’ sentiments by also considering market sentiments to model investors’ portfolio rebalancing behavior. Market sentiments are obtained by analyzing the online information through deep learning text analysis algorithms based on the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model. The stochastic neural networks-based algorithm is designed to solve the BPSM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the BPSM model on the Shanghai 50 and Hushen 300 data sets. The frame of experiments includes a dynamic portfolio rebalancing model, in which both the investors’ sentiments and the market sentiments are modeled to analyze investors’ dynamic portfolio rebalancing behavior. The experiment results show that, first, by updating the expected return rate of each period according to investors’ sentiments and market sentiments, in all cases, the BPSM model achieves a higher investment return per unit risk (Rpr) than the conventional Mean–variance (MV) model to minimize investment risk. Second, compared with the two baseline models that include only investors’ sentiments, the BPSM realizes a portfolio policy that improves investment return per unit risk (Rpr) in 70% of situations. These results reveal that incorporating investors’ behavior-related signals into the portfolio selection model is beneficial to investors’ investment results, which offers implications for financial stakeholders. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Sequential decision making and Markov decision processes are rather suited for this type of application. Through trial and error based on historical data, an agent can learn the characteristics of the market and evolve an algorithm to maximize the cumulative returns. In this work, we propose a novel RL trading algorithm utilizing random perturbation of the Q-network and account for the more realistic nonlinear transaction costs. In summary, we first design a new near-quadratic transaction cost function considering the slippage. Next, we develop a convolutional deep Q-learning network (CDQN) with multiple price input based on this cost functions. We further propose a random perturbation (rp) method to modify the learning network to solve the instability issue intrinsic to the deep Q-learning network. Finally, we use this newly developed CDQN-rp algorithm to make trading decisions based on the daily stock prices of Apple (AAPL), Meta (FB), and Bitcoin (BTC) and demonstrate its strengths over other quantitative trading methods. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is a novel method that has applications in asset pricing and that fits well within the problem of measurement in economics. Unlike econometrics, ML models are not designed for parameter estimation and inference, but similar to econometrics, they address, and may be better suited for, problems of prediction. While some ML methods have been applied in econometrics for decades, their success in prediction has been limited, and examples of this abound in the asset pricing literature. In recent years, the ML literature has advanced new, more efficient, computation methods for regularization, modeling nonlinearity, and improved out-of-sample prediction. This article conducted a comprehensive, objective, and quantitative bibliometric analysis of this growing literature using Web of Science (WoS) data. We identified trends in the literature over the past decade, the geographical distribution of articles, authorship, and institutional contributions worldwide. The paper also identifies the dominant literature using citations in WoS and discusses computational algorithms that are expanding the econometric frontiers in asset pricing. The top cited papers were reviewed, highlighting their contribution. The limitations of ML learning methods and recent advances in ML were used to provide a conic view to future ML econometric practice. © 2022 by the authors.},

Consequently, the transitions between different regimes are reflected into covariance matrices, whose time-varying coefficients react to unexpected news. Accordingly, we identify market regimes by feeding latent information embedded in the covariances to various regime-switching models and an unsupervised learning methodology. The advantage over existing methods is that our approach considers all information in the covariances to detect regimes while allowing for smooth and abrupt regime changes. We display each model's ability to correctly detect regimes through a simulation study and by evaluating a regime-switching investment strategy. Our results point to hierarchical clustering as the best-performing model for labelling market regimes with both simulated and observed data. Furthermore, we find that regime-switching models based on an observable transition variable perform well during overall periods of stress. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The asset pricing model plays an essential role in finance and has extended to all areas of finance and investment. This paper focuses on the numerical solutions of one-dimensional discrete asset pricing models, which can be translated into integral equations. To solve integral equations, an improved trigonometric extreme learning machine is developed, where the Fourier series is selected as the basis function. In particular, the sampling frequency of the trigonometric function varies with the property of data distribution, which helps to improve the accuracy of numerical solutions. The interior-point method is introduced to optimize the sampling frequency. Then, the integral equation is converted into a linear system which is solved by the extreme learning machine. This paper gives the mathematical derivation of solving the asset pricing model using the improved trigonometric extreme learning machine, which can be adapted to solve various types of integral equations. Subsequently, the improved trigonometric extreme learning machine is employed to solve the one-dimensional discrete-time asset pricing model. Simulation results demonstrate the high precision of the proposed method, which leads to less error in the approximate equity price and illustrates the feasibility of the improved trigonometric extreme learning machine. Furthermore, when the improved trigonometric extreme learning machine is compared with other related methods, the numerical simulations verify the efficiency and superiority of the proposed algorithm in solving the asset pricing model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have shown great success in many challenging quantitative trading tasks, such as portfolio management and algorithmic trading. Especially, intraday trading is one of the most profitable and risky tasks because of the intraday behaviors of the financial market that reflect billions of rapidly fluctuating capitals. However, a vast majority of existing RL methods focus on the relatively low frequency trading scenarios (e.g., day-level) and fail to capture the fleeting intraday investment opportunities due to two major challenges: 1) how to effectively train profitable RL agents for intraday investment decision-making, which involves high-dimensional fine-grained action space; 2) how to learn meaningful multi-modality market representation to understand the intraday behaviors of the financial market at tick-level. Motivated by the efficient workflow of professional human intraday traders, we propose DeepScalper, a deep reinforcement learning framework for intraday trading to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, DeepScalper includes four components: 1) a dueling Q-network with action branching to deal with the large action space of intraday trading for efficient RL optimization; 2) a novel reward function with a hindsight bonus to encourage RL agents making trading decisions with a long-term horizon of the entire trading day; 3) an encoder-decoder architecture to learn multi-modality temporal market embedding, which incorporates both macro-level and micro-level market information; 4) a risk-aware auxiliary task to maintain a striking balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk. Through extensive experiments on real-world market data spanning over three years on six financial futures (2 stock index and 4 treasury bond), we demonstrate that DeepScalper significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art baselines in terms of four financial criteria. Furthermore, we conduct a series of exploratory and ablative studies to analyze the contributions of each component in DeepScalper. © 2022 ACM.},

In this paper, we propose a new portfolio management algorithm based on long-term prediction of assets. Specially, we first predict the prices of assets for a long period through a sequence prediction algorithm which is called Informer. We then use the predicted asset price along with the trading information (e.g., the opening price, high price, low price, closing price and volume) as the environmental state of deep reinforcement learning, and obtain the trading strategies of assets through the deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To make the Informer model be more suitable for our portfolio management algorithm, we propose a new loss function, which put more focus on the trends of assets, for it. We perform experiments on both the stock market and the cryptocurrency market.

	abstract = {Money management, also known as asset allocation, is constantly at the forefront of research in the trading and investing fields. Since Markowitz established the current portfolio theory in 1952, it has drawn many experts to this intriguing topic. The Kelly criteria are one of the brightest stars among these new techniques. It provides an elegant solution for players and investors to get the best bidding fraction and maximize their logarithm worth over time. However, it ignores the fact that each investor has a different risk tolerance, and the proportion was calculated using the Kelly criterion without taking into account the downside risk. This paper attempts to develop a risk prediction model using a probability-based method and adjust the reward function of deep reinforcement learning to account for the downside risk. To summarize, rather than a naive reward function that solely optimizes the return, the improved deep reinforcement learning may consider an investor's risk tolerance. Finally, we solely analyze the scenario of a single asset and employ DXY, GBP/USD, and EUR/USD as the underlying training and validation data sets. The outcome demonstrates that the adjustment to the reward mechanism produces an interesting performance. When the required MDD (Maximum draw-down) is greater than 3%, the likelihood is on average greater than 70%. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Inspired by the celebrated LASSO regression, we regularize the mean-variance portfolio optimization by adding two regularizing terms that essentially zero out portfolio weights of some of the assets in the portfolio and select and shrink the portfolio weights of the remaining assets towards the equal weights to hedge against parameter estimation risk. We solve our PEPS formulations by applying recent advances in mixed integer optimization that allow us to tackle large-scale portfolio problems. We also build a predictive regression model for expected return using two cross-sectional factors, the short-term reversal factor and the medium-term momentum factor, that are shown to be the more significant predictive factors among the hundreds of factors tested in the empirical finance literature. We then incorporate our predictive regression into PEPS by replacing the historical mean. We test our PEPS formulations against an array of classical portfolio optimization strategies on a number of datasets in the US equity markets. The PEPS portfolios enhanced with the predictive regression estimates of the expected stock returns exhibit the highest out-of-sample Sharpe ratios in all instances.  © 2022 ACM.},

Although investing in gold is not new, the relevant literature fails to reach a consensus regarding the forces that drive gold prices or a universally accepted forecasting model that can be used in the evaluation of asset allocation in gold portfolios. In this paper, we depart from the typical econometric approaches in the field and re-evaluate gold forecasting using a hybrid method. The proposed model is based on short- and long-run decomposition of input variables using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition algorithm and forecasting each component separately based on the Support Vector Regression method.

	abstract = {Portfolio management is a fundamental problem in finance. It involves periodic reallocations of assets to maximize the expected returns within an appropriate level of risk exposure. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered a promising approach to solving this problem owing to its strong capability in sequential decision making. However, due to the non-stationary nature of financial markets, applying RL techniques to portfolio optimization remains a challenging problem. Extracting trading knowledge from various expert strategies could be helpful for agents to accommodate the changing markets. In this paper, we propose MetaTrader, a novel two-stage RL-based approach for portfolio management, which learns to integrate diverse trading policies to adapt to various market conditions. In the first stage, MetaTrader incorporates an imitation learning objective into the reinforcement learning framework. Through imitating different expert demonstrations, MetaTrader acquires a set of trading policies with great diversity. In the second stage, MetaTrader learns a meta-policy to recognize the market conditions and decide on the most proper learned policy to follow. We evaluate the proposed approach on three real-world index datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art baselines. The empirical results demonstrate that MetaTrader significantly outperforms those baselines in balancing profits and risks. Furthermore, thorough ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the components in the proposed approach. © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Portfolio management is a decision-making process of periodically reallocating a certain amount of funds into a portfolio of assets, with the objective of maximizing the profits constrained to a given risk level. Due to its nature of learning from dynamic interactions and planning for long-run performance, reinforcement learning (RL) recently has received much attention in portfolio management. However, most of existing RL-based PM approaches in general only consider price changes of portfolio assets and the implicit correlations between price changes, while ignoring the rich relations between companies in the market, such as two assets in the same sector or two companies have a supplier-customer relation, which are very important for trading decision making. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose GPM, a novel graph convolutional network-based reinforcement learning framework for portfolio management, which first employs Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) to extract asset relational features, and then combines relational features with multi-scale temporal features to make trading decisions for better performance. We also introduce softmax with temperature to increase portfolio diversity, which leads to further increase in profits. Experimental results on two real-world datasets: NASDAQ and NYSE, validate the effectiveness of GPM over state-of-the-art PM methods. Further, more experiments are conducted to evaluate GPM with different graph neural networks and different number of network layers, to explore proper settings for different markets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization is always the priority of market researchers, large financial institutional investors, Mutual Fund, and Pension funds managers. Due to high volatility in the stock market, people are less interested in the Stock market. Therefore, we designed a fusion model to predict the future stock prices which gives us maximum returns on the selected group of companies. Previously it requires a wealth manager to study how to get maximum returns on our capital. But now, in this new era, we can do it with the help of techniques like Machine Learning, Dynamic Programing, Artificial Intelligence, and Linear Programming. If we invest in one Stock, the risk is more; however, we reduce the risk by diversifying the portfolio. To diversify the risk, we need a strong portfolio of fundamentally strong stocks. Various deep learning and machine learning models have been implemented previously, but none of them has implemented Efficient Frontier combined with the approach of Mean–Variance optimization. This paper makes a novel attempt to predict realistic and correct ratios of stocks and minimum/maximum returns. This paper proposed two new algorithms: one for the Selection of fundamentally solid stocks and the next for Diversification. In-Depth research is done on the Indian Stock Market, i.e., Nifty 50. Our model will provide you with ratios in which you have to diversify capital based on fundamentals, log returns, and a dynamic approach to take maximum returns. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.},

Adding additional constraints, we compare different formulations and, obtaining the same frontier, show that the “no short selling” and “no borrowing” problem can be solved with all formulations. Then, a new projected feedforward network is shown to be able to deal with some local and global constraints on the weights of the portfolio while outperforming classical penalization methods. We extend our numerical results to assets following the Heston model, and we show that the results obtained in the Black–Scholes method still hold.

Suppose that theta*is unavailable but may be learnt by a separate process that generates a sequence of estimators thetak, each of which is an increasingly accurate approximation of theta*. We develop a first-order inexact augmented Lagrangian (AL) scheme for computing an optimal solution x*corresponding to theta*while simultaneously learning theta*. In particular, we derive rate statements for such schemes when the penalty parameter sequence is either constant or increasing and derive bounds on the overall complexity in terms of proximal gradient steps when AL subproblems are inexactly solved via an accelerated proximal gradient scheme.

Given diverse investment styles, a single trading strategy cannot serve different investor objectives. We propose an objective function formulation to augment the direct optimization approach in AlphaPortfolio (Cong et al. [6]). In addition to simple baseline Sharpe ratio used in AlphaPortfolio, we add three investor's objectives for (i) achieving excess alpha by maximizing the information ratio; (ii) mitigating downside risks through optimizing maximum drawdown-adjusted return; and (iii) reducing transaction costs via restricting the turnover rate. We also introduce four new features: momentum, short-term reversal, drawdown, and maximum drawdown to the framework. Our objective function formulation allows for controlling the trade-off between both maximum drawdown and turnover with respect to realized return, creating flexible trading strategies for various risk appetites. The maximum drawdown efficient frontier curve, derived using a range of values of hyper-parameter α, reflects the similar concave relationship as observed in the theoretical study by Chekhlov et al. [5]. To improve the interpretability of the deep neural network and drive insights into traditional factor investment, we further explore the drivers that contribute to the top and bottom performing firms by running regression analysis using Random Forest, which achieves R2 of approximately 0.8 in producing the same winner scores as our model. Finally, to uncover the balance between profits and diversification, we investigate the impact of the trading size on strategy behaviors.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {We study in this paper several problems at the intersection of decentralized optimization and online learning. Decentralized optimization plays a vital role in machine learning and has recently garnered much attention due to its inherent advantage in handling edge computations. Many decentralized optimization algorithms, both projection and projection-free algorithms with theoretical guarantees, have been proposed in the literature, focusing mainly on offline settings. However, for most real-world machine learning problems, the data is often revealed online, for example, in the case of recommender systems, image/video processing, and stock portfolio management. Therefore, in this work, we study decentralized optimization within the framework of online settings with constraints imposed on the optimization solutions (e.g., sparsity or low rank of matrices). More specifically, we consider the problem of optimizing an aggregate of convex loss functions that arrive over time such that their components are distributed over a connected network. We present a consensus-based online decentralized Frank-Wolfe algorithm that uses stochastic gradient estimates, which achieves an asymptotically tight regret guarantee of O(T) where T is a given time horizon. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of this algorithm for optimizing the online multiclass logistic regression model on real-world standard image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10) by comparing with centralized online algorithms. We achieve better regret bounds than the previously best-known decentralized constrained online algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In this paper we adopt a rational-expectations equilibrium model, supposing traders are overconfident, believe they obtain the most unique message, and overestimate counterparties' information correlation. Meanwhile, information correlation is ambiguous. Under such emotion, traders are less likely to learn from price as they underestimate the amount of information reflected in their opponents' signals, which mitigates free-riding behavior and increases trading volume. Under ambiguous environment and with risk asset price rising, traders' sentiment develops in five stages:Blind confident (with price at the top), wait and see, cautiously optimistic, wait and see, and blind confident (with price at the bottom). It is shown that, though overconfidence intensifies return's excessive volatility, it plays a dominant role in enhancing equity premium when the market is fully competitive, and thus improving social welfare. It is particularly effective at the end of a bear market and the beginning of a reversal when traders reveal blind confident. Besides, overconfidence degree affects the price momentum, but has no impact on the market efficiency. Finally, when traders are blind confident, information correlation ambiguity increases their confidence level, excessive investment and social welfare; when traders are cautiously optimistic, it has an opposite effect. © 2022 Systems Engineering Society of China.

	abstract = {This paper proposes an optimistic value iteration for steady-state mean–variance optimization in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs). The involved variance metric concerns reward variability in the long run, and future deviations are discounted to their present values. This mean–variance optimality criterion is time-inconsistent since its reward function depends on the mean, which renders traditional dynamic programming methods inapplicable. A family of policy/value iteration algorithms can be developed under a bilevel optimization algorithm framework, but there are still several problems to solve for a reinforcement learning (RL) extension. One problem is that in the value iteration, the inner optimization should achieve a near-optimal solution to ensure convergence before the outer update, which is required in every outer iteration. However, in an RL scenario, it is impractical to determine when the inner optimization should be stopped. To deal with this problem, we propose an optimistic value iteration, where the outer updates can be merged into the inner optimization with a learning rate. We prove the algorithm convergence and conduct a numerical experiment on portfolio management to validate the proposed algorithm. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Recent financial studies found that the momentum spillovers of relevant firms are salient as well for measuring asset risk. However, previous studies on asset pricing via machine learning only relied on partial of these market information types. In this study, a deep learning framework is proposed to combine these three market information types with different data structures, that is, numerical economic indicators represented as scalars, media represented as textual vectors, and the influences of related firms captured by graphs. More importantly, the unique data characteristics brought by such data fusion are well addressed in the proposed learning framework. Specifically, a matrix-based module is first proposed to fuse numerical economic data and textual media, which specifically considers the interactions of the fused features. Such fused information, along with the firm relevance represented in graphs, is further integrated by a novel self-adaptive graph neural network that can address the dynamic merging of multilinked listed firms. Experiments performed on real market data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art algorithms, including eLSTM, RGCN, and TGC. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

In this research, we suggest a Markov decision process model-based deep reinforcement learning model including deep learning methods to perform strategy optimization, called SwanTrader. To achieve better decisions of the portfolio-management process from two different perspectives, i.e., the temporal patterns analysis and robustness information capture based on market observations, we suggest an optimal deep learning network in our model that incorporates a stacked sparse denoising autoencoder (SSDAE) and a long–short-term-memory-based autoencoder (LSTM-AE). The findings in times of COVID-19 show that the suggested model using two deep learning models gives better results with an alluring performance profile in comparison with four standard machine learning models and two state-of-the-art reinforcement learning models in terms of Sharpe ratio, Calmar ratio, and beta and alpha values. Furthermore, we analyzed which deep learning models and reward functions were most effective in optimizing the agent’s management decisions.

We find that all the EMV trackers can improve the forecasting performance of crude oil market volatility. CEMV is better than OEMV, and PEMV is the best. Furthermore, the PEMV tracker can beat many other popular uncertainty predictors. The predictive ability of the PEMV tracker is consistent in a variety of robustness checks and extensions. We demonstrate that the predictability of PEMV stems from not only the volatility index (VIX), which is well-recognized for forecasting crude oil market volatility, but also the valuable information related to petroleum. In addition, the machine learning evidence suggests that PEMV is more useful than OEMV, CEMV, and other category-specific EMV trackers. Finally, the PEMV tracker can help mean-variance investors realize the largest economic gain in an asset allocation application. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

A fixed-point theorem proves that NN approximation error has a big-oh bound that we can reduce by increasing the number of NN parameters. The functional form of the trading penalty has a parameter ϵ >0 that controls the magnitude of transaction costs. When ϵ is small, we can implement an NN algorithm based on the expansion of the solution in powers of ϵ. This expansion has a base term equal to a myopic solution with an explicit form, and a first-order correction term that we compute in the RL loop.

	abstract = {The stock–bond correlation is a cornerstone of every asset allocation decision, but estimat-ing it reliably can prove to be challenging given the potential for co-movements to fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions. Using supervised machine learning techniques, this article presents a new approach for identifying key determinants of the correlation between US equity and bond returns, ultimately finding that inflation, alongside real yields, equity volatility, economic growth, and inflation uncertainty, predict changes in correlation dynamics overtime. Relative to the existing literature, the authors’ approach allows for the systematic detection of the main drivers of stock–bond correlation and uncovers the time variation in importance of each determinant across economic regimes. Upon conducting an out-of-sample portfolio evaluation, the authors show that the five factors with gradient boosting regression approach outperforms all other existing factor-based models in esti-mating both the trend and level of correlation, thereby offering an alternative robust solution for forecasting time-varying equity and bond co-movements that can be further applied to asset allocation decisions and risk management. © 2022, With intelligence.

	abstract = {Estimating high dimensional covariance matrices for portfolio optimization is challenging because the number of parameters to be estimated grows quadratically in the number of assets. When the matrix dimension exceeds the sample size, the sample covariance matrix becomes singular. A possible solution is to impose a (latent) factor structure for the cross-section of asset returns as in the popular capital asset pricing model. Recent research suggests dimension reduction techniques to estimate the factors in a data-driven fashion. We present an asymmetric autoencoder neural network-based estimator that incorporates the factor structure in its architecture and jointly estimates the factors and their loadings. We test our method against well established dimension reduction techniques from the literature and compare them to observable factors as benchmark in an empirical experiment using stock returns of the past five decades. Results show that the proposed estimator is very competitive, as it significantly outperforms the benchmark across most scenarios. Analyzing the loadings, we find that the constructed factors are related to the stocks' sector classification.  © 2022 Owner/Author.},

We find that the most important predictors tended to be consistent across models, and that non-linear models had better predictive power than linear models. Predictive power was higher in calm periods than in stressed periods. Environmental, social, and governance indicators marginally impacted the predictive power of non-linear models in our data, despite their negative correlation with maximum drawdown and positive correlation with returns.

Any errors made during the forecasting step reduce the accuracy of the asset weightings, and hence the profitability of the overall portfolio. The Portfolio Transformer (PT) network, introduced here, circumvents the need to predict asset returns and instead directly optimizes the Sharpe ratio, a risk-adjusted performance metric widely used in practice. The PT is a novel end-to-end portfolio optimization framework, inspired by the numerous successes of attention mechanisms in natural language processing. With its full encoder-decoder architecture, specialized time encoding layers, and gating components, the PT has a high capacity to learn long-term dependencies among portfolio assets and hence can adapt more quickly to changing market conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. To demonstrate its robustness, the PT is compared against other algorithms, including the current LSTM-based state of the art, on three different datasets, with results showing that it offers the best risk-adjusted performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Numerical simulation results demonstrate that our model is significantly superior in terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy compared with the model that constructed by the FPC estimation and NW estimation. Combining the current day's 5-minute closing price data of the Shanghai Securities Composite Index (SSEC) from Jan 2, 2019 to Dec 31, 2019, we employ this model to predict the next day's price gap anomaly.

However, most classical RL algorithms do not consider the exogenous and noise of financial time series data, which may lead to treacherous trading deci-sions. To address this issue, we propose a novel anti-risk portfolio trading method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). It consists of a stacked sparse denoising autoencoder (SSDAE) network and an actor–critic based reinforcement learning (RL) agent. SSDAE will carry out off-line training first, while the decoder will used for on-line feature extraction in each state. The SSDAE network is used for the noise resistance training of financial data. The actor–critic algorithm we use is advantage actor–critic (A2C) and consists of two networks: the actor network learns and imple-ments an investment policy, which is then evaluated by the critic network to determine the best action plan by continuously redistributing various portfolio assets, taking Sharp ratio as the optimization function. Through extensive experiments, the results show that our proposed method is effective and superior to the Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA), several variants of our proposed method, and a state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {At present, cloud services and cloud manufacturing are developing rapidly, speed and accuracy have become the themes of cloud manufacturing development. The core component of cloud manufacturing is resource portfolio optimization. In cloud manufacturing today, the scale of service portfolios is expanding rapidly, and the number of candidate services which in the service pool is increasing gradually. To adapt to the development of cloud services, an optimization algorithm with faster speed, greater precision and higher stability is required to solve the problem of cloud service composition and optimization (CSCO). To increase the convergence rate and avoid falling into local optima with the artificial bee colony algorithm, a self-learning artificial bee colony genetic algorithm (SLABC-GA) is proposed in this paper, which is based on reinforcement learning (RL), and the RL is used to intelligently select the number of dimensions of each update of a feasible solution. A global optimal individual is used to search and guide the search equation to avoid obtaining local optima and improve algorithm development and the precision of the traditional artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC). A genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced in a later stage of the algorithm to further improve its accuracy and convergence speed. Additionally, this paper analyzes and constructs the self-learning model in SLABC, the optimal learning method is Q-learning algorithm, and designs a reward method and state determination method of RL in the environment of the bee colony algorithm. Finally, a large number of comparative experiments have been carried out, the results show that the accuracy and speed of the SLABC-GA outperform for CSCO problems, and the performance of the SLABC-GA for large-scale CSCO problems is better than that of genetic algorithm (GA) and the traditional artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Stock is one of the most important targets in investment. However, it is challenging to manually design a profitable strategy in the highly dynamic and complex stock market. Modern portfolio management usually employs quantitative trading, which utilizes computers to support decision-making or perform automated trading. Deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) is an emerging machine learning technology that can solve multi-step optimal control problems. In this article, we propose a method to model multi-stock trading process according to reinforcement learning theory and implement our trading agents based on two popular actor-critic algorithms: A2C and PPO. We train and evaluate the agents on two datasets from 2010–2021 Chinese stock market multiple times. The experimental results show that both agents can achieve an annual return rate that outstrips the baseline by 8.8% and 16.8% on average on two datasets, respectively. Asset curve and asset distribution chart are plotted to prove that the policy the agent learned is reasonable. We also employ a track training strategy, which can further enhance the agent’s performance by about 7.7% with little extra training time. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Our theoretical results link forecasting horizon inversely to expectational feedback, and predict a positive relationship between expectational feedback and various measures of asset-price volatility. We design a laboratory experiment to test these predictions. Consistent with our theory, short-horizon markets are prone to substantial and prolonged deviations from rational expectations, whereas markets with even a modest share of long-horizon forecasters exhibit convergence. Longer-horizon forecasts display more heterogeneity but also prevent coordination on incorrect anchors – a pattern that leads to mispricing in short-horizon markets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Due to the ever-changing business environment, enterprises are facing unprecedented challenges in their new-product development (NPD) processes, while the success and survival of NPD projects have become increasingly challenging in recent years. Thus, most enterprises are eager to revamp existing NPD processes so as to enhance the likelihood of new products succeeding in the market. In addition to the determination of sustainable new-product ideas and designs, new-product portfolio management (NPPM) is an active research area for allocating adequate resources to boost project development, while projects that perform poorly can be terminated. Since the existing new-product portfolio configuration is manually decided, this study explores the possibility of standardising NPPM, particularly the configuration mechanism, in a systematic manner. Subsequently, case-based reasoning can be applied to structure the entire NPPM process, in which past knowledge and successful cases can be used to configure new projects. Furthermore, customer feedback was analyzed using the transfer-learning-based text classification model in the case-retrieval process to balance the values of enterprises and customers. A new-product portfolio was therefore configured to facilitate NPPM under an agile–stage-gate model. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, a case study in a printer manufacturing company was conducted, where positive feedback and performances were found. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper aimed to develop a useful Machine Learning (ML) model for detecting companies with lasting competitive advantages (companies’ moats) according to their financial ratios in order to improve the performance of investment portfolios. First, we computed the financial ratios of companies belonging to the S&P 500. Subsequently, we assessed the stocks’ moats according to an evaluation defined between 0 and 5 for each financial ratio. The sum of all the ratios provided a score between 0 and 100 to classify the companies as wide, narrow or null moats. Finally, several ML models were applied for classification to obtain an efficient, faster and less expensive method to select companies with lasting competitive advantages. The main findings are: (1) the model with the highest precision is the Random Forest; and (2) the most important financial ratios for detecting competitive advantages are a long-term debt-to-net income, Depreciation and Amortization (D&A)-to-gross profit, interest expense-to-Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT), and Earnings Per Share (EPS) trend. This research provides a new combination of ML tools and information that can improve the performance of investment portfolios; to the authors’ knowledge, this has not been done before. The algorithm developed in this paper has a limitation in the calculation of the stocks’ moats since it does not consider its cost, price-to-earnings ratio (PE), or valuation. Due to this limitation, this algorithm does not represent a strategy for short-term or intraday trading. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Owing to the uncertainty around the coupling and decoupling of oil and gas prices, this study re-examines the relationship between oil and gas markets by modeling the price of one energy source based on the price of the other, both linearly and nonlinearly. We present an autoregressive exogenous model and three nonlinear frameworks with different patterns of asymmetry. Based on daily data from January 7, 1997, to December 29, 2017, our analysis reaches two main findings. First, the nonlinear frameworks outperform the linear model (i.e., the autoregressive exogenous model) in modeling the relationship between oil and gas prices. Second, the nature of asymmetry varies based on market direction. We show that when oil prices exhibit an extreme movement (i.e., beyond a threshold value in absolute value), gas prices react nonlinearly, and that there is no relationship otherwise. Our results are robust for other frequencies, mainly weekly and monthly. These findings explain the conflicting results in the literature on the complex relationship between these markets. The results might serve investors in term of hedging, portfolio diversification, and asset allocation as we show that in the calm period, there is no relationship between oil and gas prices; however, the interaction between markets is more pronounced during periods of extreme movement. Similarly, policymakers’ awareness of the nonlinear dynamic under extreme movements could inform the regulation policy and/or adjustment in case oil (gas) prices increase or decrease. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Currently, the most popular cryptocurrency is bitcoin. Predicting the future value of bitcoin can help investors to make more educated decisions and to provide authorities with a point of reference for evaluating cryptocurrency. The novelty of the proposed prediction models lies in the use of artificial intelligence to identify movement cryptocurrency prices, particularly bitcoin prices. A forecasting model that can accurately and reliably predict the market’s volatility and price variations is necessary for portfolio management and optimization in this continually expanding financial market. In this paper, we investigate a time series analysis that makes use of deep learning to investigate volatility and provide an explanation for this behavior. Our findings have managerial ramifications, such as the potential for developing a product for investors. This can help to expand upon our model by adjusting various hyperparameters to produce a more accurate model for predicting the price of cryptocurrencies. Another possible managerial implication of our findings is the potential for developing a product for investors, as it can predict the price of cryptocurrencies more accurately. The proposed models were evaluated by collecting historical bitcoin prices from 1 January 2021 to 16 June 2022. The results analysis of the GRU and MLP models revealed that the MLP model achieved highly efficient regression, at R = 99.15% during the training phase and R = 98.90% during the testing phase. These findings have the potential to significantly influence the appropriateness of asset pricing, considering the uncertainties caused by digital currencies. In addition, these findings provide instruments that contribute to establishing stability in cryptocurrency markets. By assisting asset assessments of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, our models deliver high and steady success outcomes over a future prediction horizon. In general, the models described in this article offer approximately accurate estimations of the real value of the bitcoin market. Because the models enable users to assess the timing of bitcoin sales and purchases more accurately, they have the potential to influence the economy significantly when put to use by investors and traders. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Changes in crude oil prices have a strong impact on global stock markets. As the largest importer of crude oil, China's international crude oil market and stock market have a strong risk of contagion. It is of great significance to study the stochastic resonance effect between crude oil market and Chinese stock market. This paper proposes the dynamic risk resonance analysis method based on econophysics and machine learning. From the perspective of stochastic resonance in nonequilibrium statistical physics, we set up a new periodic capital asset pricing model based on econophysics and asset pricing theory, and introduce signal power amplification to describe the risk resonance effect of crude oil price and Chinese stock market. Then, we analyze the dynamic risk resonance between crude oil and stock market impacted by systemic risk and investor heterogeneity. The results demonstrate that: (1) Based on machine learning and predictive testing, the in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting results show that the proposed new periodic model has better fitting performance than the benchmark model; (2) There are optimal system parameters and period information to minimize the risk resonance effect between two markets; (3) The existence of optimal investor heterogeneity leads to inverse resonance behavior between the two markets, which greatly reduces the contagion of market risks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Therefore, investors need to choose an appropriate asset portfolio to hedge the risk of bitcoin with traditional financial assets. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are the most advanced sequential learning methods in deep learning of time series prediction, which can accurately predict the prices of financial assets and thus provide traders with the most profitable asset portfolio. In this paper, LSTM-CNN asset price prediction models are developed with data of gold and bitcoin in 2016-2021 as research samples to obtain return maximizing trading strategy.

Then, five popular machine learning tools were utilized to generate predictions. According to our findings, the long short-term memory model combined with the composite sentiment index performed the best due to a lower rate of prediction errors and greater directional accuracy for time-series forecasting of one-day-ahead prices.

	abstract = {As an asset pricing model in economics and finance, factor model has been widely used in quantitative investment. Towards building more effective factor models, recent years have witnessed the paradigm shift from linear models to more flexible nonlinear data-driven machine learning models. However, due to low signal-to-noise ratio of the financial data, it is quite challenging to learn effective factor models. In this paper, we propose a novel factor model, FactorVAE, as a probabilistic model with inherent randomness for noise modeling. Essentially, our model integrates the dynamic factor model (DFM) with the variational autoencoder (VAE) in machine learning, and we propose a prior-posterior learning method based on VAE, which can effectively guide the learning of model by approximating an optimal posterior factor model with future information. Particularly, considering that risk modeling is important for the noisy stock data, FactorVAE can estimate the variances from the distribution over the latent space of VAE, in addition to predicting returns. The experiments on the real stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of FactorVAE, which outperforms various baseline methods.

	abstract = {In the era of big data, investor sentiment will have an impact on personal decision making and asset pricing in the securities market. This paper uses the Easteconomy stock forum and Sina stock forum as the carrier of investor sentiment to measure the positive sentiment index based on stockholders’ comments and to construct an evaluation index system for the public opinion dimension. In addition, the evaluation index system is constructed from four dimensions, which include operation, innovation, finance and financing, to evaluate the overall condition of listed companies from multiple perspectives. In this paper, the SBM model in the data envelopment analysis method is used to measure the efficiency values of each dimension of the multidimensional efficiency evaluation index system, and the efficiency values of each dimension are the multidimensional efficiency indicators. Subsequently, two sets of input feature indicators of the SVM model were established: one set contains traditional financial indicators and multidimensional efficiency indicators, and another set has only traditional financial indicators. The early warning accuracy of the two sets of input feature indicators was empirically analyzed based on the support vector machine early warning model. The results show that the early warning model incorporating multidimensional efficiency indicators has improved the accuracy compared with the early warning model based on traditional financial indicators. Then, the model was optimized by the particle swarm intelligent optimization algorithm, and the robustness of the results was tested. Moreover, six mainstream machine learning methods, including Logistic Regression, GBDT, CatBoost, AdaBoost, Random Forest and Bagging, were used to compare with the early warning effect of the DEA–SVM model, and the empirical results show that DEA–SVM has high early warning accuracy, which proves the superiority of the proposed model. The findings of this study have a positive effect on further preventing and controlling the financial crisis risk of Chinese-listed companies and promoting as well as facilitating the healthy growth of Chinese-listed companies. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to portfolio formation strategy based on a hybrid machine learning model that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with robust input features obtained from Huber’s location for stock prediction and the Markowitz mean-variance (MV) model for optimal portfolio construction. Specifically, this study first applies a prediction method for stock preselection to ensure high-quality stock inputs for portfolio formation. Then, the predicted results are integrated into the MV model. To comprehensively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, we used two portfolio models, the MV model and the equal-weight portfolio (1/N) model, with LSTM, BiLSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM, and employed them as benchmarks. Between January 2015 and December 2020, historical data from the Stock Exchange of Thailand 50 Index (SET50) were collected for the study. The experiment shows that integrating preselection of stocks can improve MV performance, and the results of the proposed method show that they outperform comparison models in terms of Sharpe ratio, mean return, and risk. © 2022 by the authors.},

By exploiting the repetitive nature of online optimization, we can greatly speed up the solution time. Our approach encodes the optimal solution into a small amount of information denoted as strategy using the voice of optimization framework. In this way, the core part of the optimization routine becomes a multiclass classification problem that can be solved very quickly. In this work, we extend that framework to real-time and high-speed applications focusing on parametric mixed-integer quadratic optimization. We propose an extremely fast online optimization method consisting of a feedforward neural network evaluation and a linear system solution where the matrix has already been factorized. Therefore, this online approach does not require any solver or iterative algorithm. We show the speed of the proposed method both in terms of total computations required and measured execution time. We estimate the number of floating point operations required to completely recover the optimal solution as a function of the problem dimensions. Compared with state-of-the-art MIO routines, the online running time of our method is very predictable and can be lower than a single matrix factorization time. We benchmark our method against the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi obtaining up to two to three orders of magnitude speedups on examples from fuel cell energy management, sparse portfolio optimization, and motion planning with obstacle avoidance. © 2022 INFORMS.},

Issues, such as global warming or social unrests, have made the problem of sustainable project portfolio selection a vital process for many firms. In other words, the success of firms in reaching their stated goals requires a selection of the best portfolio of projects. Given the importance of this topic, this paper presents a novel mathematical modeling approach for sustainable project portfolio selection. The model regards staff assignment based on learning and forgetting effects. Moreover, financing each phase of the projects is determined while addressing the possibility of outsourcing. To make it possible to consider uncertain decision-making environments, interval type-2 fuzzy sets are used, and a new uncertain optimization process is extended. The application of the model shows that it is capable of assisting the main decision makers in finding the best portfolio of sustainable projects while performing staff assignments based on learning and forgetting effects, finding a proper outsourcing plan, and selecting the best financing option for projects under uncertainty. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

R-GCN generalizes the traditional graph convolutional neural network and can process multi-relational data, building an encoder and identifying multiple relations between entities in the project library by accessing different layers to solve corresponding modeling problems, so as to accurately identify the linkages among a large number of power grid infrastructure projects, and further improve the rationality of portfolio optimization.

	abstract = {Objective Image aesthetic assessment is oriented to simulate human perception of beauty and identify image-related aesthetic quality assessment. It is essential for computer vision applications in the context of image forecasting, photos portfolio management, image enhancement and retrieval. Current image aesthetic quality evaluation method has been mainly focused on three major tasks as mentioned below: 1 ) aesthetic binary classification: divide images quality into high aesthetic and low aesthetic context; 2) aesthetic score regression: calculate the overall aesthetic average score of an image; 3 ) aesthetics distribution prediction: predict the probability of different aesthetic ratings of an image. Beyond binary classification to aesthetic score regression, more aesthetic information can be provided via the prediction of aesthetic distribution. However, these methods are still restricted of the factors of aesthetic prior knowledge and challenged for the source of aesthetic feeling. Image attributes has rich aesthetic contexts like content, brightness, depth of field and color richness. As a "hub" between image low-level features and aesthetic quality, these attributes can enhance the interpretability of aesthetic evaluation and play an important role in image aesthetic quality assessment. The aesthetic quality of an image is judged with a specific scene in common. Specifically, people make aesthetic judgments according to multiple aesthetic attributes. There is a strong correlation between aesthetic attributes and aesthetic quality, and the aesthetic attributes can provide interpreta-ble details for aesthetic quality assessment. For instance, to assess a portrait image, we focus on the details of the foreground rather than those of the background. In contrast, we tend to treat the details less important than in the assessment of a portrait image for assessing a landscape image. Hence, we facilitate an image aesthetic attribute prediction model based on multi-tasks deep learning technique, which uses scene information to assist image aesthetic attributes prediction. More accurate image aesthetic score prediction is achieved. Method The model consists of a two-stream deep residual network. To obtain the scene information of the image, the first stream of the network is trained based on the scene prediction task. To predict the aesthetic attributes and overall aesthetic scores of the image, the second stream is used to extract the aesthetic features of the image, and then combine the two features for training through multi-tasks learning. In order to use the scene information of the image to assist the prediction of aesthetic attributes, we train the first stream of the network to predict the image scene category. After training the scene prediction stream, we train the attribute prediction stream via attributes-labeled aesthetic images. We use concatenation to fuse the features of the dual-stream network, and the full connection layers are trained to obtain the joint distribution of the aesthetic attributes and the overall score. For each image aesthetic attribute, we want to get its individual regression score. Our mean square error ( MSE) loss function is used to measure the degree of difference between the predicted value and the ground truth. Our experiment is based on the aesthetic and attributes database (AADB). AADB consists of a total of 10 000 images, and the standard partition is followed on the basis of 8 500 images for training, 500 images for validation and the remaining 1 000 images for testing. We scale the images to 256 x256 x3 before inputting to the network. The i7-10700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX 1660 super CPU are equipped. The batch size is set to 12, epoch is set to 15, and adam optimization algorithm is used. The learning rate of the backbone network is set to IE -5, and the learning rate of fully connected network is set to IE -6. In Combination with the image scene information, the proposed model improves the prediction accuracy in terms of the image aesthetic attributes and aesthetic scores. Result Our method has improved the prediction accuracy of the majority of aesthetic attributes, and the correlation coefficient of the overall aesthetic score prediction has also improved about 6% , which is feasible to melt scene information into the prediction of aesthetic attributes. Conclusion The integrated scene information for aesthetic attributes prediction clarify the intimate relation between image scene category and aesthetic attributes, and the experimental results demonstrate that our scene information has its potentials for image aesthetic quality assessment. The future research direction can be focused on deep relationship between scene semantics and image aesthetics. This deep relationship could build a more robust image aesthetic assessment framework, which can consistently improve the performance of image aesthetic quality assessment, as well as enhance the interpretability of aesthetic assessment. © 2022 Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG.

	abstract = {The traditional portfolio theory has relied heavily on historical asset returns while ignoring future information. Based on ensemble learning and maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio theory, this paper proposes a two-stage portfolio optimization method by considering asset forecast information, aiming to improve the performance and robustness of a portfolio. In the first stage, concerning the underlying asset selection, we integrate six individual prediction models using the ensemble learning method to forecast the future return of assets where the assets with higher potential returns are selected for portfolio optimization. In the second stage, we propose a novel investment strategy by combining the forecasted returns of selected assets with the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio model. In the empirical analysis, we employ the constituent stocks of the China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300) to test the out-of-sample performance of the proposed strategy with several traditional portfolio strategies, including minimum variance portfolio strategy, traditional maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio strategy, 1/N portfolio strategy, and CSI 300 index. Our analytical results show that (1) compared to individual forecasting models, the ensemble learning method is more accurate in forecasting stock returns, and (2) the proposed portfolio strategy largely outperforms most of its competitors in terms of the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Omega ratio, and Calmar ratio. This indicates that the proposed two-stage portfolio optimization method is of potential to construct a promising investment strategy due to its trade-off between historical and future information of assets.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The victory of portfolio construction is mostly based on the future stock market performance. Recently, the developed machine learning techniques bring more significance of involving the prediction theory for selecting the portfolio. Implementing the return prediction of conventional time series methods in portfolio generation can enhance the efficiency of real portfolio optimization method. But, expert systems and deep structured learning methods has gives awesome performance when comparing other time series methods, in this work integrates return prediction in portfolio formation with hybridized deep learning method named Deep Belief-Recurrent Neural Network (DBRNN). The forecasting of the portfolio is performed by the optimal training (weight optimization) of RNN with DBN, by the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm termed Harris Hawks-Deer Hunting Optimization (HH-DHO). The newly developed optimization algorithm does not fall into the local optimum owing to the integrated method of exploration in the DHOA and HHO. The combination of standard algorithms is confirmed that it is better for solving the test problems and is it is very competitive and realistic over other conventional algorithms. Thus, it reveals that the implemented HH-DHO can highly balance the “exploration and exploitation” phases. With the predicted information by the integrated deep learning model, the best companies that high returns are optimally selected by the same hybrid HH-DHO. It can be enlarge the prediction performance of the designed approaches. On observing the analysis, the acquired results reveal that the suggested method is superior to existing ways and benchmarks in terms of returns and risks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) is an actor-critic method, a typical DRL method in continuous action space. Despite the success of DRL in financial trading, surprisingly, most of the literature ignores the element of risk control. The research is proposed to combine long- and short-term risk (LSTR) control with the TD3 algorithm to build a portfolio model with risk management capabilities. Using Chinese stock data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange, we train and validate the proposed portfolio model. Performances were compared to the TD3 model without risk control.

We explore these effects by using computational linguistics and deep structured learning algorithms to analyze financial newspapers and social media posts. After controlling for factors related to content and market momentum in our narrative based credibility indicator, we find that news credibility is positively correlated with the returns on assets preferred by experts and negatively correlated with assets preferred by gamblers. Based on this finding, we point out that the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is not appropriate in the dominant market of gamblers in the short-term.

We investigate the optimal consumption, investment, and retirement decisions when the mean return of a risky asset is unobservable and is estimated by filtering from historical prices. To ensure nonnegativity of the consumption rate and the borrowing constraints on the wealth process of the representative agent, we conduct our analysis using a duality approach. We link the dual problem to American option pricing with stochastic volatility and prove that the duality gap is closed. We then apply our theory to a hidden Markov model for regime-switching mean return with Bayesian learning. We fully characterize the existence and uniqueness of variational inequality in the dual optimal stopping problem, as well as the free boundary of the problem. An asymptotic closed-form solution is derived for optimal retirement timing by small-scale perturbation. We discuss the potential applications of the results to other partial-information settings.

This study presents a new MV model constructed using stationary portfolios composed of cointegrated stocks. The expected return of this new model is predicted by using machine learning models, such as support vector machine, random forest, and attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The proposed model is evaluated using data on stocks in the CSI 300 and the S&P 500, with 42 features over 8 years from May 4, 2012 to August 4, 2020. The empirical results show that the portfolio constructed based on the stationary portfolios in both the Chinese and the US stock markets delivers significant profits. Further, the attention-based LSTM network can more accurately model the spread return using technical indicators, financial investment information, and lagged returns, and can successfully select pairs of cointegrated stocks for constructing a more profitable MV portfolio, than can conventional machine learning models. Using the attention-based LSTM to predict 20-day return movement results in model accuracy of up to 92.59% for the CSI 300 and 88.52% for the S&P 500, and a corresponding Sharpe ratio of 9.31 and 2.77, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Existing methods in portfolio management deterministically produce an optimal portfolio. However, according to modern portfolio theory, there exists a trade-off between a portfolio’s expected returns and risks. Therefore, the optimal portfolio does not exist definitively, but several exist, and using only one deterministic portfolio is disadvantageous for risk management. We proposed Dirichlet Distribution Trader (DDT), an algorithm that calculates multiple optimal portfolios by taking Dirichlet Distribution as a policy. The DDT algorithm makes several optimal portfolios according to risk levels. In addition, by obtaining the pi value from the distribution and applying importance sampling to off-policy learning, the sample is used efficiently. Furthermore, the architecture of our model is scalable because the feed-forward of information between portfolio stocks occurs independently. This means that even if untrained stocks are added to the portfolio, the optimal weight can be adjusted. We also conducted three experiments. In the scalability experiment, it was shown that the DDT extended model, which is trained with only three stocks, had little difference in performance from the DDT model that learned all the stocks in the portfolio. In an experiment comparing the off-policy algorithm and the on-policy algorithm, it was shown that the off-policy algorithm had good performance regardless of the stock price trend. In an experiment comparing investment results according to risk level, it was shown that a higher return or a better Sharpe ratio could be obtained through risk control. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The banking sector is on the eve of a serious transformation and the thrust behind it is artificial intelligence (AI). Novel AI applications have been already proposed to deal with challenges in the areas of credit scoring, risk assessment, client experience and portfolio management. One of the most critical challenges in the aforementioned sector is fraud detection upon streams of transactions. Recently, deep learning models have been introduced to deal with the specific problem in terms of detecting and forecasting possible fraudulent events. The aim is to estimate the unknown distribution of normal/fraudulent transactions and then to identify deviations that may indicate a potential fraud. In this paper, we elaborate on a novel multistage deep learning model that targets to efficiently manage the incoming streams of transactions and detect the fraudulent ones. We propose the use of two autoencoders to perform feature selection and learn the latent data space representation based on a nonlinear optimization model. On the delivered significant features, we subsequently apply a deep convolutional neural network to detect frauds, thus combining two different processing blocks. The adopted combination has the goal of detecting frauds over the exposed latent data representation and not over the initial data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In terms of shrinking the pricing factors, the elastic net method performs slightly better than LASSO. In addition, momentum, trading friction, and value and growth factors have more contribution to pricing, which suggests that our capital market is not perfect and the trading habits of market participants should be improved, and reflects the continuous improvement and effectiveness of Chinese stock market.

	abstract = {Deep learning has achieved greater success in optimizing solutions associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI). In the financial domain, it is widely used for stock market prediction, trade execution strategies and portfolio optimization. Stock market prediction is a very significant use case in this domain. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with advanced AI models have gained significance of late. However, it is used in image-image-translation and other computer vision scenarios. GANs are not used much for stock market prediction due to its difficulty in setting the right set of hyperparameters. In this paper, overcome this problem with reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization. A deep learning framework based on GAN, named Stock-GAN, is implemented with generator and discriminator. The former is realized with LSTM, a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), while the latter uses Convolutional Neural Network. An algorithm named Generative Adversarial Network based Hybrid Prediction Algorithm (GAN-HPA) is proposed. An empirical study revealed that Stock-GAN achieves promising performance in stock price prediction when compared with the state of the art model known as Multi-Model based Hybrid Prediction Algorithm (MM-HPA). Afterwards, MM-HPA and GAN-HPA combined to form yet another hybrid model known as MMGAN-HPA for improved performance over MM-HPA and GAN-HPA. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {The growing popularity of quantitative trading in pursuit of a systematic and algorithmic approach to investment has drawn considerable attention among traders and investment firms. Consequently, an effective computational method for evaluating potential risk factors and returns is crucial for the development of algorithmic trading strategies. In traditional finance and financial engineering research, statistical approaches have been widely applied to quantitative analysis. Meanwhile, investor demand for quantitative hedge funds has surged worldwide. In the current study, the multiperiod portfolio selection problem was considered in terms of the realistic transaction cost model, which is a major concern for quantitative hedge fund managers. We developed a dedicated multiagent-based deep reinforcement learning framework with a two-level nested agent structure to determine effective portfolio management methods with different objectives. In addition, we proposed a specially-designed reward function for investment performance evaluation and a novel policy network structure for trading decision-making. To efficiently identify specific asset attributes in a portfolio, each agent is equipped with a refined deep policy network and a special training method that enables the proposed reinforcement learning agent to learn risk transfer behaviors. The results revealed the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which outperformed several established or representative portfolio selection strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In a complex and changeable stock market, it is very important to design a trading agent that can benefit investors. In this paper, we propose two stock trading decision-making methods. First, we propose a nested reinforcement learning (Nested RL) method based on three deep reinforcement learning models (the Advantage Actor Critic, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, and Soft Actor Critic models) that adopts an integration strategy by nesting reinforcement learning on the basic decision-maker. Thus, this strategy can dynamically select agents according to the current situation to generate trading decisions made under different market environments. Second, to inherit the advantages of three basic decision-makers, we consider confidence and propose a weight random selection with confidence (WRSC) strategy. In this way, investors can gain more profits by integrating the advantages of all agents. All the algorithms are validated for the U.S., Japanese and British stocks and evaluated by different performance indicators. The experimental results show that the annualized return, cumulative return, and Sharpe ratio values of our ensemble strategy are higher than those of the baselines, which indicates that our nested RL and WRSC methods can assist investors in their portfolio management with more profits under the same level of investment risk. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Existing linear models do not account for nonlinearities and variable interactions, while complex machine learning models are easily overfitting. In this paper, motivated by the portfolio sorts methods in empirical asset pricing, we propose an alternative approach called grouping-based AdaBoost by adapting the existing AdaBoost. It introduces the experience of the financial field into the algorithm design to improve the performance and generalization of machine learning-based factor investing strategies. The proposed method restricts the factor to only predict the common part of the returns of the same groups and allows the potential nonlinear relationship between a factor and the return. Moreover, to enhance the model's ability to use factors with high correlation, we extend the single-grouping AdaBoost in a multi-grouping way. Experiments on the Chinese A-share market demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both stock performance classification and portfolio selection and provide intuitive evidence for the generalization of the proposed method. © 2022 IEEE.},

In this research, we use the Reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the portfolio management problem. In the Reinforcement learning algorithm, we adopt the squeeze-and-excitation in the neural network neural network to realize the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators proposed by Jiang et al. The Squeeze-and-Excitation block works by adaptively recalibrating channel-wise feature responses, which improves the ability of the network in extracting information from the financial environment. To further improve the performance of the network, we adopt the soft thresholding function as nonlinear transformation layers to effectively eliminate the noise-related features. The cryptocurrency market is used to test the efficacy of our strategy along with eight traditional portfolio management strategies as well as Jiang et al.'s strategies. In our experiments, we use the Accumulated Portfolio Value, Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Downward to assess the efficacies of the strategies. In conclusion, our strategy outperforms Jiang et al.'s strategies and other traditional strategies. Although our strategy has a nearly 30% Maximum Downward as metrics in back-tests, Accumulated Portfolio Value can reach nearly 170% in two different two-month back-tests, which is about 160% greater than the traditional strategy and Jiang et al.'s strategy. Moreover, our result Sharp ratios are 393.88% and 96.18% higher than the traditional strategy and Jiang et al.'s strategy, respectively. © 2022 IEEE.},

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has fueled the energy maker more volatile. In such uncertain contexts, an Early Warning System (EWS) would efficiently contribute to stabilizing market swings. It will leverage the ability to control operating costs and pave the way for smooth economic recovery. Within this framework, we deploy Machine Learning (ML) models to forecast energy equity prices by employing uncertainty indices as a proxy for predicting energy market volatility. We empirically examine the comparative effectiveness of prevalent ML models and conventional approaches (regression) to forecast the energy equity prices by utilizing the daily data from 1/6/2011 to 18/1/2022 for four US uncertainty and eight energy equity indices. Results show that the Nonlinear Autoregressive with External (Exogenous) parameters (NARX) of Neural Networks (NN) scored significantly better accuracy than all other (25) ML models and conventional approaches. The study outcomes are beneficial for policymakers, governments, market regulators, investors, hedge and mutual funds, and corporations.

	abstract = {Making investment decisions under uncertainty has always been a challenge for investors. There have been extensive number of studies in the literature, proposing methods under the portfolio optimization framework. The majority of the theoretical and practical approaches focused on two different perspectives, return and risk. However, optimizing with respect to these variables has been a notoriously difficult task due to the stochastic and unpredictable nature of the financial time series. To avoid such difficulties, investors could invest in portfolios managed by professionals according to predetermined criteria. One common approach for this is to invest in index funds. They provide a generic risk and return profile via market-capitalization weighting method, thus, they are good fit for many investors. In this study, we seek to gain better performance than this weighting method. Accordingly, we propose two reinforcement learning agents to solve this portfolio optimization problem under Markov decision process framework. These models do not have a prior knowledge about the stock market environment, they directly learn by trial-and-error and output policy as the portfolio weighting model. We train our models with a dataset composed of price indicators and fundamental company information. The proposed models were tested with BIST30 market constituents in a 1 year time duration. We show that these agents can generate 45% greater returns and 1.17 greater Sharpe ratio compared to BIST30 market index. While generating higher returns, we also encourage agents to diversify the portfolio through a modified reward function to increase real life applicability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Existing approaches for learning stock embeddings either require expert knowledge, or mainly focus on the textual part of information corresponding to individual temporal movements. In this paper, we propose to model stock properties as the combination of internal attributes and relational attributes, which takes into consideration both the time-invariant properties of individual stocks and their movement patterns in relation to the market. To learn the two types of attributes from financial news and transaction data, we design several training objectives based on contrastive learning to extract and separate the long-term and temporary information in the data that are able to counter the inherent randomness of the stock market. Experiments and further analyses on portfolio optimization reveal the effectiveness of our method in extracting comprehensive stock information from various data sources.  ©2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

	abstract = {ℓ0 constrained optimization is prevalent in machine learning, particularly for high-dimensional problems, because it is a fundamental approach to achieve sparse learning. Hard-thresholding gradient descent is a dominant technique to solve this problem. However, first-order gradients of the objective function may be either unavailable or expensive to calculate in a lot of real-world problems, where zeroth-order (ZO) gradients could be a good surrogate. Unfortunately, whether ZO gradients can work with the hard-thresholding operator is still an unsolved problem. To solve this puzzle, in this paper, we focus on the ℓ0 constrained black-box stochastic optimization problems, and propose a new stochastic zeroth-order gradient hard-thresholding (SZOHT) algorithm with a general ZO gradient estimator powered by a novel random support sampling. We provide the convergence analysis of SZOHT under standard assumptions. Importantly, we reveal a conflict between the deviation of ZO estimators and the expansivity of the hard-thresholding operator, and provide a theoretical minimal value of the number of random directions in ZO gradients. In addition, we find that the query complexity of SZOHT is independent or weakly dependent on the dimensionality under different settings. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our method on a portfolio optimization problem as well as black-box adversarial attacks. © 2022 Neural information processing systems foundation.

To synthesize data from markets around the world both at the individual country level and across much broader regional areas, this paper selects major world indices to construct portfolio as they reflect countries' markets. Besides, the corresponding exchange rates to U.S. dollars are considered to add currency effect into consideration. For each index, one random forest model is employed in forecasting expected returns and calculates volatility based on those. In this research, machine learning models are applied first for index preselection. Then, this paper uses predicted return and volatility in mean-variance portfolio formation. According to the analysis, random forest models outperform the conventional linear models and the currency exchange rate shows significant impacts in return prediction.

	abstract = {Financial portfolio management (PM) is one of the most applicable problems in reinforcement learning (RL) owing to its sequential decision-making nature. However, existing RL-based approaches rarely focus on scalability or reusability to adapt to the ever-changing markets. These approaches are rigid and unscalable to accommodate the varying number of assets of portfolios and increasing need for heterogeneous data input. Also, RL agents in the existing systems are ad-hoc trained and hardly reusable for different portfolios. To confront the above problems, a modular design is desired for the systems to be compatible with reusable asset-dedicated agents. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent RL-based system for PM (MSPM). MSPM involves two types of asynchronously-updated modules: Evolving Agent Module (EAM) and Strategic Agent Module (SAM). An EAM is an information-generating module with a Deep Q-network (DQN) agent, and it receives heterogeneous data and generates signal-comprised information for a particular asset. An SAM is a decision-making module with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent for portfolio optimization, and it connects to multiple EAMs to reallocate the corresponding assets in a financial portfolio. Once been trained, EAMs can be connected to any SAM at will, like assembling LEGO blocks. With its modularized architecture, the multi-step condensation of volatile market information, and the reusable design of EAM, MSPM simultaneously addresses the two challenges in RL-based PM: scalability and reusability. Experiments on 8-year U.S. stock market data prove the effectiveness of MSPM in profit accumulation by its outperformance over five different baselines in terms of accumulated rate of return (ARR), daily rate of return (DRR), and Sortino ratio (SR). MSPM improves ARR by at least 186.5% compared to constant rebalanced portfolio (CRP), a widely-used PM strategy. To validate the indispensability of EAM, we back-test and compare MSPMs on four different portfolios. EAM-enabled MSPMs improve ARR by at least 1341.8% compared to EAM-disabled MSPMs. © 2022 Huang, Tanaka.

	abstract = {Portfolio managements in financial markets involve risk management strategies and opportunistic responses to individual trading behaviours. Optimal portfolios constructed aim to have a minimal risk with highest accompanying investment returns, regardless of market conditions. This paper focuses on providing an alternative view in maximising portfolio returns using Reinforcement Learning (RL) by considering dynamic risks appropriate to market conditions through dynamic portfolio rebalancing. The proposed algorithm is able to improve portfolio management by introducing the dynamic rebalancing of portfolios with vigorous risk through an RL agent. This is done while accounting for market conditions, asset diversifications, risk and returns in the global financial market. Studies have been performed in this paper to explore four types of methods with variations in fully portfolio rebalancing and gradual portfolio rebalancing, which combine with and without the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices for adjusting the technical indicator centring. Performances of the four methods have been evaluated and compared using three constructed financial portfolios, including one portfolio with global market index assets with different risk levels, and two portfolios with uncorrelated stock assets from different sectors and risk levels. Observed from the experiment results, the proposed RL agent for gradual portfolio rebalancing with the LSTM model on price prediction outperforms the other three methods, as well as returns of individual assets in these three portfolios. The improvements of the returns using the RL agent for gradual rebalancing with prediction model are achieved at about 27.9–93.4% over those of the full rebalancing without prediction model. It has demonstrated the ability to dynamically adjust portfolio compositions according to the market trends, risks and returns of the global indices and stock assets. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As the number of people infected with COVID-19 continues to rise, a number of nations have implemented state wide quarantines. This has resulted in a global financial crisis that is having severe impacts on countries all around the world. As a direct consequence of the epidemic, unemployment rates have increased in a number of different regions, which has a substantial and detrimental effect on trade across the globe. In light of the current state of the economy, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is causing a shift in the manner in which businesses evaluate their bitcoin holdings. The application of AI in a commercial setting has the potential to produce a wide range of beneficial results. We are spared from completing as much manual labour as a direct result of the favourable effects that AI has had on technology. These consequences can be noticed in our day-to-day lives. In the event that there is a pandemic, having knowledge of AI and the various strategies it employs, such as the classifier model, could be beneficial. Humans will be better suited to make decisions if they have rapid access to the analyses and projections that are created by AI and big data. In order to be prepared for the arrival of the new world, the company is putting in more effort, in collaboration with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups, to improve the administration of virtual enterprises by having a presence on a variety of different e-trade systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being utilised in a variety of settings to assist with the process of identifying and implementing workable solutions to a variety of problems that can develop in the workplace. AI is being used to improve business operations in a wide variety of spheres, including marketing, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, customer assistance, portfolio management, and product recommendations based on customer preferences. These are just few of the sectors. These are just a few examples of the kinds of problems that artificial intelligence might be able to solve in the future.

Advanced forecasting technology can promote the maturity of transactions. Our model takes the lead in introducing the rolling learning prediction method of feedforward multilayer neural network (MLP), which provides a method for accurately predicting market fluctuations from another way. We improved the original algorithm and changed the unified learning method to the rolling learning method based on the existing data before each day. Our practice has proved that our technology has better prediction effect for assets with less market volatility. For example, for gold, a safe haven asset, our prediction accuracy is 99.5%; For products with large market fluctuations, the prediction accuracy is relatively low. For example, for speculative assets with large market fluctuations such as bitcoin, our prediction accuracy is also as high as 97%. © 2022 SPIE.},

	abstract = {The objective of portfolio management is to realize portfolio optimization, i.e., maximizing the cumulative return of the portfolio over continuous trading periods. Using Artificial Intelligence algorithms, e.g., Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), to realize portfolio optimization is an emerging research trend. Jiang et al.'s Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) framework achieves at least a four-fold improvement in the indicator of final portfolio value. Their framework has high flexibility to allow us to replace components to achieve continuous improvement. In EIIE, the DRL agent uses neural networks to extract data features from historical data of assets and evaluate each asset's potential growth. This paper introduces a novel network architecture called Dense Based EIIE (DBE), which is embedded in an DRL framework based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Densely Convoluted Neural Network (DenseNet) module. Compared to Jiang et al.'s strategy, our improved framework uses DenseNet to achieve the EIIE framework, further increasing profitability. In all three experiments carried out, our strategy outperforms Jiang et al.'s strategy and nine traditional strategies. Our strategy achieves at least a 17% improvement in cumulative return compared to other strategies. Furthermore, it achieves at least twice as much in Sharpe Ratio as other strategies.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The present paper deals with optimizing the stock portfolio of active companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange based on the forecast price. This paper is based on a combination of different filtering methods such as optimization of trading rules based on technical analysis (ROC, SMA, EMA, WMA, and MACD at six levels - Very Very Weak (VVW), Very Weak (VW), Weak (W), Strong (S), Very Strong (VS), and Very Very Strong (VVS)), Markov Chains, and Machine Learning (Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) Filter stock exchanges and provide buy signals between 2011 and 2020. In proportion to each combination of filtering methods, a buy signal is issued and based on the mean-variance (M-V) model, the stock portfolio is optimized based on increasing the portfolio return and minimizing the stock portfolio risk. Based on this, out of 480 companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange, 85 active companies have been selected and stock portfolio optimization is based on two algorithms, MOGWO and NSGA II. The analysis results show that the use of SVM learning machine leads to minor correlation error than the random forest method. Therefore, this method was used to predict stock prices. Based on the results, it was observed that if the shares of companies are filtered, the risk of transactions decreases, and the return on the stock portfolio increases. Also, if two filtering methods are applied simultaneously, the stock portfolio returns slightly and the risk increases. In the analysis, MOGWO algorithm has obtained 133.13% stock return rate with a risk of 3.346%, while the stock portfolio returns in NSGA II algorithm 107.73, with a risk of 1.459%. Comparison of solution methods shows that the MOGWO algorithm has high efficiency in stock portfolio optimization. © 2022 Nasrin Bagheri Mazraeh et al.},

On the strategic level, the organization relies on (a) a robust strategic information systems plan that shields long-term investments and annual funding; (b) a corporate governance body which represents major stakeholders; and (c) a stable funding mechanism for IT investments over time. In the case of operational governance, portfolio management decisions have been devolved to committees representing major business processes, and new prioritizing procedures following agile models have been put in place. These committees also monitor execution and return on investment. Lastly, this model has been evaluated through a survey among all participants.

The policy gradient method from reinforcement learning and convolutional neural network/recurrent neural network/convolutional neural network concatenated with the recurrent neural network from deep learning are combined together to build the agents. With the proposed models, three types of portfolios are tested: stocks portfolio which has a positive influence due to the Covid-19, stocks portfolio which has a negative influence due to the Covid-19, and portfolio of stocks combined with cryptocurrency which are randomly selected. The performance of our DRL agents was compared with that of equal-weighted agent and all the money fully invested on one stock agents. All of our DRL agents showed the best performance on the randomly selected portfolio, which has an overall stable up-ticking trend. In addition, the performance of linear regression model was also tested with the random selected portfolio, and it shows a poor result compared to other agents. © 2022, EasyChair.

To allow agents to express a wide variety of risk-reward profiles, we assess the value of a policy using rank dependent expected utility (RDEU). RDEU allows agents to seek gains, while simultaneously protecting themselves against downside risk. To robustify optimal policies against model uncertainty, we assess a policy not by its distribution but rather by the worst possible distribution that lies within a Wasserstein ball around it. Thus, our problem formulation may be viewed as an actor/agent choosing a policy (the outer problem) and the adversary then acting to worsen the performance of that strategy (the inner problem). We develop explicit policy gradient formulae for the inner and outer problems and show their efficacy on three prototypical financial problems: robust portfolio allocation, benchmark optimization, and statistical arbitrage. © 2022 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics},

	abstract = {Modern financial problems are essentially complex mathematical problems. The most important and common problems are combinatorial optimization problems in finance, such as common stock investment, financial management, etc. Among such problems, linear system solving problems are of this type. The core of the problem. Now with the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence technology, it has been well applied in the financial industry, but with the advent of the era of big data, massive amounts of data have brought huge challenges to the solution of classic solving methods and computing resources. Lloyd et al. proposed an HHL algorithm for solving linear systems. Under some assumptions, this algorithm can solve linear equations with exponential acceleration compared to classical algorithms. It is a key step in current quantum machine learning algorithms. More classic algorithms can achieve exponential acceleration. In this paper, the use of HHL algorithm to solve combinatorial optimization problems in finance has been researched and tested. The problem is described as a quadratic programming problem with equality constraints and the corresponding program design is carried out, verified and the final system state is carried out. The results are measured, and the results are analyzed. It is found that compared with the classical solution method, the HHL algorithm can be used to solve such combinatorial optimization problems, and the approximate solution obtained is in good agreement with the exact solution, which can be applied well. The solution process of such combinatorial optimization problems can be accelerated, and quantum computing can be better applied to such problems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This enables us to use recent research which applies machine learning tools to stochastic control to find optimal action functions. In this paper, we define differentiable reinforcement learning as a particular case of this research. We find that incorporating deep learning in this framework leads to more accurate and stable solutions than those obtained from more generic actor critic algorithms. We apply this deep differentiable reinforcement learning (DDRL) algorithm to the problem of one asset optimal trading strategies in various environments where the market dynamics are known. Thanks to the stability of this method, we are able to efficiently find optimal strategies for complex multi-scale market models. We also extend these methods to simultaneously find optimal action functions for a wide range of environment parameters. This makes it applicable to real life financial signals and portfolio optimization where the expected return has multiple time scales. In the case of a slow and a fast alpha signal, we find that the optimal trading strategy consists in using the fast signal to time the trades associated to the slow signal. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Enhanced index tracking (EIT) is an active research area in portfolio management that focuses on adding reliable value relative to the index on the basis of mimicking the behavior of the benchmark index. To solve the EIT problem, many approaches have been proposed. However, it still remains a critical challenge to efficiently generate a portfolio with good quality. In this study, we propose a learning-based approach named IntelliPortfolio for the EIT problem. IntelliPortfolio uses PCA and clustering to select stock and estimates the investment weight for each constituent stock using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Two advantages of the proposed algorithm are as follows. (1) It considers both the fundamentals and the price information for stocks and can balance the trade-off between the performance and the diversity of the selected stocks. (2) It uses a LSTM model to estimate investment weights, which is more capable to handle long sequences of input and is more robust to predict the future trend of stock market. Experimental results on the five real-world datasets of the international stock market illustrate the significant performance superiority of the proposed approach in comparison with five state-of-the-art algorithms.  © 2022 Kan Yi et al.},

	abstract = {Index tracking is one of the most popular passive strategy in portfolio management. However, due to some practical constrains, a full replication is difficult to obtain. Many mathematical models have failed to generate good results for partial replicated portfolios, but in the last years a data driven approach began to take shape. This paper proposes three heuristic methods for both selection and allocation of the most informative stocks in an index tracking problem, respectively XGBoost, Random Forest and LASSO with stability selection. Among those, latest deep autoencoders have also been tested. All selected algorithms have outperformed the benchmarks in terms of tracking error. The empirical study has been conducted on one of the biggest financial indices in terms of number of components in three different countries, respectively Russell 1000 for the USA, FTSE 350 for the UK, and Nikkei 225 for Japan. © 2022 - IOS Press.

	abstract = {Advancements in technology, complemented with the abundance of static and historical data brought AI and digital automation adapted very well into the oil and gas industry. Specially to solve the challenges by the engineers in selecting well intervention candidates. In Attaka Field, a multi-layered offshore field in Indonesia, workover and well service (WOWS) have been one of the strategies to reduce production decline. With traditional workflows that absorb data from multiple unconsolidated sources and data format and resource limitation, reviewing 400+ wells that penetrates more than 200 reservoirs may take 2-3 months process with a reduced scope of review. As an addition, not all data and values are justified for the prioritization process. An intelligent automated solution termed as WEPON was developed to improve decision speed and quality in Attaka Field WOWS candidate screening. WEPON was built on top of a data science platform to ease the development, production and maintenance of the analytics engine and its data pipeline. More than 15 data sources, ranging from reservoir properties, allocated production data, up to well schematics were consumed and aggregated in this solution's flow. The main components for WEPON includes: 1. Technical analysis with analytics and ML plus multicriteria decision-making process to identify high potential completions, both produced and virgin ones 2. Adopting from the field's old workflow, feasibility checks to surface and subsurface constraints for the proposed completions 3. Diagnosing the wells and determine the right workover/ intervention opportunities 4. Calculating each well's subsurface and surface risks, and historical success rate to be integrated with the well's NPV to produce its expected value (EV) 5. Running on-demand economic analysis accessible from the solution's UI, the engine is tied into the operator's economic analysis tool that contains the currently used calculation and scheme 6. A presentation of the results on a web-based application. As the main process is triggered to be run on a weekly basis, the automation of WEPON helps to increase Attaka Field review size to the whole fields, as well as reducing 89.7% of time from 3 days to review a well to hours of run to review the whole field, enabling engineers to spend more time on high-cognitive components of the existing workflows. Moreover, it has shifted the approach to a more data-driven one leading up to smarter decisions. The implementation of this WEPON is the pilot in the Indonesian National Oil Company, PERTAMINA. This is also the first time the solution developed on a data science platform, allowing the tool to be evergreen and extensible process. This implementation is also the first one to integrate an economic analysis tool through its API.  Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {The process of constantly reallocating budgets into financial assets, aiming to increase the anticipated return of assets and minimizing the risk, is known as portfolio management. Processing speed and energy consumption of portfolio management have become crucial as the complexity of their real-world applications increasingly involves high-dimensional observation and action spaces and environment uncertainty, which their limited onboard resources cannot offset. Emerging neuromorphic chips inspired by the human brain increase processing speed by up to 500 times and reduce power consumption by several orders of magnitude. This paper proposes a spiking deep reinforcement learning (SDRL) algorithm that can predict financial markets based on unpredictable environments and achieve the defined portfolio management goal of profitability and risk reduction. This algorithm is optimized for Intel's Loihi neuromorphic processor and provides 186x and 516x energy consumption reduction compared to a high-end processor and GPU, respectively. In addition, a 1.3x and 2.0x speed-up is observed over the high-end processors and GPUs, respectively.

Starting from the premise that accurate forecasting is now a key capability for analyzing problems of business operations and public policy, we investigate the performance of alternative prediction methods that include both traditional econometric approaches as well as novel algorithms from the field of machine learning. The article tests a total of 109 different regression-type algorithms across five pertinent business domains-employee absenteeism, success of online communication, real estate asset pricing, support ticket processing, and demand forecasting. The results indicate that forecasting algorithms tend to produce a set of widely dispersed outcome, with some methods such as random forecast and neural network implementations being able to consistently generate superior performance. We further argue that forecast accuracy is not necessarily predicated upon computational complexity and thus, an optimization decision between the costs and benefits of using a certain algorithm can feasibly be made. © 2022, Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite.

	abstract = {Investors frequently make business about volatile assets with the goal of maximizing their profits. This aim of this article is to establishes a model to study the investment strategy of bitcoin and gold. It's not always accurate to use algorithm based on traditional time series model to predict the prices. Therefore, The multi-layer LSTM weighted model of multi-layer LSTM network this article puts forward is used to study the input time span to factor the influence of output time span. By using the embed approach, this model can achieve higher accuracy compared with LSTM model by influencing the stacking sequence generation cycle and training model. Meanwhile, this model introduced the Attention mechanism and can make short-term and long-term forecasts continuously. It also quantified the fluctuation of MACD, RSI, Apriori and other parameters to construct the risk measurement index. The higher the periodic price fluctuation is, the greater the risk can be. The results show that timely business maximizes profits. An initial $1,000 investment on September 10, 2021 can even profit more than $900,000. In order to prove the model provides the best strategy, depth of reinforcement learning model is set up. Bitcoin and gold history feature information of state data matrix and agent within the depth of neural network is utilized to extract the stable characteristics of data expression. Based on these features, this model utilized optimized strategy method of three reinforcement learning algorithms. Combined with the current reward, it optimized the relevant parameters of the deep neural network to obtain the optimal investment strategy in exploratory ways. Moreover, the model will be ran twice to test the sensitivity under different transaction costs (investment decision results) by setting points of 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2% according to the percentage of increase and decrease of transaction costs. The results show that the model has good robustness, which means the model constructed in this paper has good results under different transaction costs. © 2022 IEEE.},

A high-yield RL-based system does not sufficiently indicate it is unbiased. The system might as well display the biases which humans may have during financial trading owing to the resemblant decision-making and rewarding mechanism between human investors and RL agents. In this study, we investigate the proxies of two biases in financial investment, disposition effect (DE) and narrow framing (NF), in a cutting-edge RL-based system for PM: MSPM. The experimental results on 135 different portfolios during the year 2021 indicate that MSPM has significantly lower degrees of DE (-0.1477) and NF (0.0904) compared to human investors.

	abstract = {The study explores the risks and benefits of investors in e-commerce financing under the background of "double carbon"to maximize investors' interests and reduce investment losses. The Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) algorithm model of e-commerce enterprise financing based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is mainly studied. First, according to the worldwide literature, the theoretical concept and principle of the CAPM are deeply studied and analyzed. Then, from the perspective of "double carbon,"with the financing risk characteristics of listed companies responding to the "double carbon"policy as samples, the CAPM model of e-commerce financing under the BPNN algorithm is established. Next, the BPNN is used to input the financing samples of e-commerce enterprises and train the model. The verification experiment of the capital asset financing model of e-commerce enterprises is further conducted. The experimental results show that the model error is the smallest when the number of neurons in the hidden layer reaches about 20. Therefore, the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the model is set to 20. When the number of iterations in training reaches 3000, the financing risk model begins to show a convergence trend. Finally, it can be determined that the number of adaptive iterations of the model is 3000. When the learning rate is 0.03, the oscillation of the model is smaller and stabler, so the model learning rate is 0.03, and the final model error is only 9.96×10-8. Based on this, e-commerce enterprises can achieve the purpose using this model to adjust the coefficient in financing in the future. The results have certain reference significance for e-commerce financing risk assessment under a "double carbon"background.  © 2022 Guojing Geng and Zhigui Guan.},

	abstract = {An Investment is a present-day pledge of money or an asset in the hope that it will bring future benefits. An investor can invest in fixed income securities, equities, derivatives, gold, or real estate. An investor's portfolio can contain a mixture of these assets. Financial Portfolio Optimization is a process that maximizes the return and minimizes the risk for an investor. With increasing population and commodities, finance has become a very complex and vast field. Earlier, investment options were minimal; now, with the introduction of the internet, investment opportunities know no bounds. The portfolio is a collection of assets. An 'Asset' is an entity that is convertible into cash. Assets bring future benefits. There are two types of assets: movable and immovable. Movable assets are stocks, mutual funds, etc. Immovable assets are physical properties, buildings, land, sophisticated machinery, etc. Assets can also be categorized as tangible and non-tangible. Assets such as gold, vehicle which have physical existence are 'tangible,' Assets such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, bonds, and stocks are 'non-tangible. A bond gives an investor a fixed income equal to an agreed contract. Stock gives an investor a part of the money earned in the form of dividends. Other non-tangible financial assets are the financial index, interest rate, currency, commodities, etc. The stock market is volatile and difficult to predict. The statisticians and machine learning experts have tried to forecast the stock market. This paper compares the prediction capability of both statistical and machine learning models. The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolution Neural Network(CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are compared. It is observed that CNN outperforms other models for the given period of study. It is also observed that machine learning models fair better than the statistical model. © 2022 IEEE.},

These sharp leaps of human ingenuity are known as industrial revolutions, and we are currently in the midst of the fourth such revolution, coined Industry 4.0 by the World Economic Forum. Building on their guideline set of technologies that encompass Industry 4.0, we present a full set of pillar technologies on which Industry 4.0 project portfolio management rests as well as the foundation technologies that support these pillars. A complete model of an Industry 4.0 factory which relies on these pillar technologies is presented. The full set of pillars encompasses cyberphysical systems and Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and big data, robots and drones, cloud computing, 5G and 6G networks, 3D printing, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain technology. These technologies are based on a set of foundation technologies which include advances in computing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials, energy, and finally cube satellites. We illustrate the confluence of all these technologies in a single model factory. This new factory model succinctly demonstrates the advancements in manufacturing introduced by these modern technologies, which qualifies this as a seminal industrial revolutionary event in human history. © 2022 Georgios Tsaramirsis et al.},

While this model excels in being easy to analyze and generalize and has a closed form solution, it omits concrete and accurate criteria to assess the utility of a withdrawal. This research presents a novel utility function for assessing withdrawal efficiency, based on the framework of the consistency principle. This principle proposes that maximum utility is achieved when the withdrawal amount is constant at target percentage α through the planning horizon. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and is solved using dynamic programming. A simulation study confirms the model's accuracy by simulating 10,000 random walks. While the model uses sample data from SPY and TLT ETFs, the model is versatile to incorporate exogenously provided portfolios. It also factors in longevity risk with minor modification. The paper proposes future avenues of exploration to expand the number of variables and use reinforcement learning as a method to resolve significantly more complex problems. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Enhanced indexing, which has been used by professional portfolio managers for decades, is a portfolio management strategy that attempts to increase returns by building a portfolio around core, index-like positions and adding tactical tilts toward specific styles or individual stocks. This paper proposes an improved enhanced indexation model by considering the systematic risk, measured by Beta value, and the industry rotation phenomenon. The systematic risk is the risk related to the stock market as a whole and can be reasonably controlled to improve portfolio performance, by actively tracking and forecasting the market trend. Sector rotation refers to the investment strategy of taking money that's invested in one stock market industry and moving it to another, by taking advantage of the historical performances of specific industries during different phases of the cycle. In specific, our model aims to find a small set of industries that is mostly likely to thrive in the anticipated future, which is mathematically realized by dividing stocks into industries and minimizing their (Formula presented.) norm. To evaluate our strategy, we conducted extensive numerical experiments against some major world indices, e.g. CSI 300, S&P 500, FTSE 100 and Nikkei 225. The experimental result shows that our approach can generate sparse portfolios with excellent out-of-sample excess returns and high robustness after deducting transaction costs. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Belief-driven learning dynamics can explain the interplay between participation rates, subjective risk, and stock price volatility. When agents adaptively learn about the risk and return, my model generates 25% of the excess volatility observed in US stock prices, while also matching key moments. With learning about risk, excess volatility of stock prices is driven by fluctuations in the participation rate that arise because agents' risk estimates vary with prices. I find that learning about risk is quantitatively more important than learning about returns.  © },

The goal is to ensure feasibility with respect to constraints and risk-based objectives such as conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) during the execution of the policy, using probabilistic models of the state transitions to guide policy adjustments. The framework is particularly amenable to the class of sequential resource allocation problems since feasibility with respect to typical resource constraints cannot be enforced in a scalable manner. The NP framework provides an alternative that adds modest overhead during the online phase. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the NP framework on two continuous real-world tasks: (i) the portfolio optimization problem with liquidity constraints for financial planning, characterized by non-stationary state distributions; and (ii) the dynamic repositioning problem in bike sharing systems, that embodies the class of supply-demand matching problems. We show that the NP framework produces policies that are better than deep RL and other baseline approaches, adapting to non-stationarity, whilst satisfying structural constraints and accommodating risk measures in the resulting policies. Additional benefits of the NP framework are ease of implementation and better explainability of the policies. © 2022 UAI. All Rights Reserved.},

One of the difficulties stated was the resistance of organizational units to the changes in the business process, organizational structure, and work culture. In this article, the roadmapping implementation phases at Arcelik A.S., a durable consumer goods company, utilizing roadmapping as a part of the strategic planning process will be discussed. One of the unique contributions of the Arcelik A.S. case study is that the roadmapping methodology integration to other processes, such as strategic planning, portfolio management, and human resources planning, was done seamlessly. The needs and roadmapping implementation challenges in a company, which is expanding itself from local to global, solutions generated for a more suitable application, and lessons learned for roadmapping continuity will be discussed in detail. These learnings could help organizations in adapting similar approaches. The case study could also be a source of academic research on the roadmapping methodology.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

Deep reinforcement learning has many advantages and can already outperform human players in many challenging video games. This paper defines the Markov decision process (MDP) model of stock portfolio trading. In order to diversify the weight of investment, on the basis of introducing entropy to improve the deep deterministic strategy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, this paper proposes a portfolio strategy based on technical indicators. Based on deep reinforcement learning, the strategy is studied from two aspects: technical indicators and covariance of portfolio stocks to further improve returns. It calculates technical indicators based on the stock's closing, opening, high, and low prices, and then calculates the covariance of the portfolio. Input the closing price, technical indicators, covariance, stock share, and fund balance as state input, and output the portfolio value. The constituent stocks of the CSI 300 Index are selected as the stocks to be traded in the portfolio for experiments, and the results show that the strategy proposed in this paper has higher returns in terms of yield and Sharpe ratio. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we have implemented a high-frequency quantitative system that can obtain stable returns for the Chinese A-share market, which has been running for more than 3 months (from March 27, 2020 to June 30, 2020) with the expected results. A number of rules and barriers exist in the Chinese A-share market such as trading restrictions and high fees, as well as scarce and expensive hedging tools. It is difficult to achieve stable absolute returns in such a market. Stock correlation analysis and price prediction play an important role to achieve any profitable trading. The portfolio management and subsequent trading decisions highly depend on the results of stock correlation analysis and price prediction. However, it is nontrivial to analyze and predict any stocks, being time-varying and affected by unlimited factors in a given market. Traditional methods only take some certain factors into consideration but ignore others that may be changed dynamically. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model named Graph Attention Long Short-Term Memory (GALSTM) to learn the correlations between stocks and predict their future prices automatically. First, a multi-Hawkes Process is used to initial a correlation graph between stocks. This procedure provides a good training start as the multi-Hawkes Processes will be studied on the most saint feature fluctuations with any correlations being statistically significant. Then an attention-based LSTM is built to learn the weighting matrix underlying the dynamic graph. In addition, we also build matching data process plus portfolio management modules to form a complete system. The proposed GALSTM enables us to expand the scope of stock selection under the premise of controlling risks with limited hedging tools in the A-share market, thereby effectively increasing high-frequency excess returns. We then construct a long and short positions combination, select long positions in the A shares of the entire market, and use stock index futures to short. With GALSTM model, the products managed by our fully automatic quantitative trading system achieved an absolute annual return rate of 44.71% and the standard deviation of daily returns is only 0.42% in three months of operation. Only 1 week loss in 13 weeks of running time. © 2021},

Computational experience on a variety of problems, namely, multiperiod portfolio optimization, classification of data coming from functional magnetic resonance imaging, restoration of images corrupted by Poisson noise, and classification via regularized logistic regression, provides substantial evidence that interior point methods, equipped with suitable linear algebra, can offer a noticeable advantage over first-order approaches. © 2022 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications.

	abstract = {In recent times, electronic portfolios (e‐portfolios) are being increasingly used by students and lifelong learners as digital online multimedia résumés that showcase their skill sets and achievements. E‐portfolios require secure, reliable, and privacy‐preserving credential issuance and verification mechanisms to prove learning achievements. However, existing systems provide private institution‐wide centralized solutions that primarily rely on trusted third parties to issue and verify credentials. Furthermore, they do not enable learners to own, control, and share their e‐portfolio information across organizations, which increases the risk of forged and fraudulent credentials. Therefore, we propose a consortium blockchain‐based e‐portfolio management scheme that is decentralized, secure, and trustworthy. Smart contracts are leveraged to enable learners to completely own, publish, and manage their e‐portfolios, and also enable potential employers to verify e‐port-folio credentials and artifacts without relying on trusted third parties. Blockchain is used as an immutable distributed ledger that records all transactions and logs for tamper‐proof trusted data provenance, accountability, and traceability. This system guarantees the authenticity and integrity of user credentials and e‐portfolio data. Decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials are used for user profile identification, authentication, and authorization, whereas verifiable claims are used for e‐portfolio credential proof authentication and verification. We have designed and implemented a prototype of the proposed scheme using a Quorum consortium blockchain network. Based on the evaluations, our solution is feasible, secure, and privacy‐preserving.

In addition, the Sharpe ratio is used to measure the adjusted rate of return for each strategy.

This makes deep models less flexible, adaptable and generalizable.Based on causal intervention and invariance, this study proposes a directional pruning and network structure optimization method based on a CNN deep model.The optimization method performs invariant-based intervention modulation on the model input, then analyzes the output distribution of the pretrained network convolutional substructure according to the generated modulation picture sequence, and filters and directionally prunes the noise-sensitive substructure.On this basis, the objective function based on inter-class differentiation and the inter-layer connection of the network are constructed with the help of the Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM)used in the field of economics.The network topology that can increase the inter-class differentiation under a single classification task is generated, and the stable characteristics of the concept level are optimized layer by layer.The experimental results on the ImageNet-2012 dataset show that the optimized deep model improves the classification accuracy of the ResNet50 baseline pre-training model by about 5 percentage points, and greatly reduces the size of the training set. © 2022, Editorial Office of Computer Engineering.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to shed light on the output of project management (PM) dynamic capabilities Specifically, the study investigates what effect PM dynamic capabilities have on company performance, both directly and indirectly, through the mediation effect of project and portfolio performance. Additionally, it tests whether program performance might also mediate the relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses were tested using partial least squares with a sample of 63 international firms that engage in projects globally. Findings: The main finding of this research is that PM dynamic capabilities do not influence firm performance directly but do so indirectly by increasing firms' performance in projects, programs and portfolios. Both project and portfolio performance have a mediation effect on the relationship between dynamic capabilities and firm performance, but portfolio performance absorbs all this effect when the two performances are in the model. Originality/value: This paper sheds light on the link between dynamic capabilities and firm performance. It tests the real outcome of dynamic capabilities by making an explicit distinction between firm performance at three intermediate levels (project, program and portfolio) and overall firm performance. Moreover, it opens the black box of dynamic capabilities and empirically operationalizes the theoretical model of sensing-seizing-transforming as the three constituting routines of dynamic capabilities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The theory and application of panel data modeling is an important field of econometric research, but the existing theoretical assumptions of panel data are inconsistent with the actual situation that the data generation behavior and parameter distribution of economic variables are constantly changing; The asymptotic theory is also inconsistent with the characteristics of panel data in practical applications, and it is difficult to guarantee the excellent properties of model parameter estimators. This paper is about the development of Bayesian model of financial data. The model is based on MCMC sampling algorithm and uses two kinds of priori: A priori distribution of mean and variance and a priori distribution of parameters. We also propose an efficient method to estimate the posterior distribution from MCMC samples. The proposed model can be used in many applications, such as stock market analysis and portfolio management. For example, it can be used to analyze the daily returns of stocks or portfolios and predict future returns by using historical data. It can also be used to study the factors that affect investment performance or the relationship between risk and return. © 2022 IEEE.},

For accurate actions to be taken, appropriate forecasts need to be made on each asset, hence the need to develop methods to aid the process. As a tilt from the conventional methodology of forecasting involving use of curve fitting techniques, and multi-level computational analysis, data driven approaches can be employed. This study presents the applications of data driven approaches to forecast production. Deep learning neural network algorithm and statistics- based data driven approach were considered. An LSTM model was developed and for the statistical algorithms, an ARIMA model, and a Holt Winters model was developed. The models were deployed, and the performance of the models were checked to determine more accurate approach for forecasting. Error analysis on the results form the models showed that the deep learning neural network model provided better results in comparison to the statistical models with an MAE of 0.0328. Based on the model performances, LSTM model can be considered for use in forecasting petroleum production overcoming effects of seasonal changes, and production anomalies in the life of the reservoir. © 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that uses neural networks to mimic the behaviour of the human brain. Various types of models are used in deep learning technology. This article will look at two important models and especially concentrate on unsupervised learning methodology. The two important models are as follows: the supervised and unsupervised models. The main difference is the method of training that they undergo. Supervised models are provided with training on a particular dataset and its outcome. In the case of unsupervised models, only input data is given, and there is no set outcome from which they can learn. The predicting/forecasting column is not present in an unsupervised model, unlike in the supervised model. Supervised models use regression to predict continuous quantities and classification to predict discrete class labels; unsupervised models use clustering to group similar models and association learning to find associations between items. Unsupervised migration is a combination of the unsupervised learning method and migration. In unsupervised learning, there is no need to supervise the models. Migration is an effective tool in processing and imaging data. Unsupervised learning allows the model to work independently to discover patterns and information that were previously undetected. It mainly works on unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning can achieve more complex processing tasks when compared to supervised learning. The unsupervised learning method is more unpredictable when compared with other types of learning methods. Some of the popular unsupervised learning algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, Apriori algorithm, clustering, anomaly detection, association mining, neural networks, etc. In this research article, we implement this particular deep learning model in the marketing oriented asset allocation of high level accounting talents. When the proposed unsupervised migration algorithm was compared to the existing Fractional Hausdorff Grey Model, it was discovered that the proposed system provided 99.12% accuracy by the high level accounting talented candidate in market-oriented asset allocation. © 2022 MengYang Liu et al.},

	abstract = {We propose a framework, called neural-progressive hedging (NP), that leverages stochastic programming during the online phase of executing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. The goal is to ensure feasibility with respect to constraints and risk-based objectives such as conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) during the execution of the policy, using probabilistic models of the state transitions to guide policy adjustments. The framework is particularly amenable to the class of sequential resource allocation problems since feasibility with respect to typical resource constraints cannot be enforced in a scalable manner. The NP framework provides an alternative that adds modest overhead during the online phase. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the NP framework on two continuous real-world tasks: (i) the portfolio optimization problem with liquidity constraints for financial planning, characterized by non-stationary state distributions; and (ii) the dynamic repositioning problem in bike sharing systems, that embodies the class of supply-demand matching problems. We show that the NP framework produces policies that are better than deep RL and other baseline approaches, adapting to non-stationarity, whilst satisfying structural constraints and accommodating risk measures in the resulting policies. Additional benefits of the NP framework are ease of implementation and better explainability of the policies. © 2022 Proceedings of the 38th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, UAI 2022.

	abstract = {Portfolio management is essential to reduce risks and maximize profits. It can be classified into two processes: stock selection and allocation. Stock selection identifies stocks with high expected profits, whereas stock allocation determines the investment ratios for the selected stocks. Most current stock selection methods employ a ranking approach that predicts a ranked stock list based on the relations between stocks. However, the ranking-based stock selection methods do not consider the stock allocation problem. Furthermore, the methods use either simple graphs or hypergraphs, but not both. The sole use of simple graphs or hypergraphs induces information loss as the collective or pairwise relations, respectively, are disregarded. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel portfolio management framework called ASA that combines ranking models with classification and regression models for autonomous stock selection and allocation. For stock selection, the simple graph- and hypergraph-based ranking models are hybridized for relational modeling to select the most profitable stocks. For stock allocation, the classification and regression models are combined to determine the investment ratio. Furthermore, ASA extracts robust features using hierarchical clustering, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction, following which it captures temporal information using long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, and the Hawkes attention mechanism. The performance of ASA is compared with that of deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results for stocks included in the Standard & Poor's 500 index demonstrate that ASA achieves a compounded annual growth rate of 58.2%, which is 39.1%P higher than that of the second-best performing method.  © 2013 IEEE.},

To deal with such difficulties, this paper proposes a policy gradient based particle swarm optimizer (PG-PSO). By combining PSO with policy gradient algorithm in reinforcement learning, the proposed method provides a novel PSO parameters adjustment mechanism which improved the optimization accuracy while at the same time reducing the workloads of manually configuring parameters. A policy neural network as an agent is constructed and interacts with the particle swarm to realize the adaptive update of PSO parameters. According to the test results of several typical benchmark functions, it can be seen that PG-PSO has better performance compared with other algorithms mentioned in this paper. The experimental results of POP show that PG-PSO can also improve Sharpe ratio value of the entire portfolio more effectively.  © 2022 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.},

More specifically, we aim to maximize the inner rate of risk aversion, a recently proposed performance measure that incorporates higher moments of the portfolio return distribution and disaster risk. Our portfolio design includes cardinality, box, and budget constraints; an upper bound for the portfolio turnover maintains a control on the transaction costs during rebalancing phases. The algorithm uses a compressed coding scheme to encode the dependent variables into continuous ones to handle portfolio cardinalities. A repair operator deals with box and budget constraints, and an adaptive penalty function approach is used for the turnover constraint. The profitability of the developed investment strategy is tested using data from the MSCI World Index. The out-of-sample results show that our approach can consistently outperform the benchmark index and the cardinality constrained mean-variance model.  © 2022 IEEE.},

We model stock trading as a Markov Decision Process problem because of its stochastic and interactive nature. Then, we define the trading objective as a problem of maximization, while the DRL agents used are actor-critic algorithms. The selected portfolio consists of 30 most liquid Islamic stocks in Indonesia that constitute JII index and compare with that of the benchmark portfolio, namely the 45 most liquid conventional stocks or LQ45. The performance is compared using several algorithms The result show that trading on Islamic stocks from January 2019 to December 2020 using the DRL agents could outperform the benchmark index of conventional stocks. Using DRL agents, fund managers would be able to optimize the portfolio on daily basis, minimize risk during crisis or turbulence, and outperform the conventional stocks. © 2022 ournal of Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

We deconstruct this stylized fact by comparing historical forecasts of portfolio optimization inputs with subsequent out-of-sample values. We confirm that historical forecasts are imprecise guides of subsequent values, but we discover the resultant forecast errors are not entirely random. They have predictable patterns and can be partially reduced using their own history. Learning from past forecast errors to calibrate inputs (akin to empirical Bayesian learning) generates portfolio performance that reinforces the case for optimization. Furthermore, the portfolios achieve performance that meets expectations, a desirable yet elusive feature of optimization methods.

It is widely assumed that a trade-off between computational complexity and regret is unavoidable, with Cover’s Universal Portfolios algorithm, SOFT-BAYES and ADA-BARRONS currently constituting its state-of-the-art Pareto frontier. In this paper, we present the first efficient algorithm, BISONS, that obtains polylogarithmic regret with memory and per-step running time requirements that are polynomial in the dimension, displacing ADA-BARRONS from the Pareto frontier. Additionally, we resolve a COLT 2020 open problem by showing that a certain Follow-The-Regularized-Leader algorithm with log-barrier regularization suffers an exponentially larger dependence on the dimension than previously conjectured. Thus, we rule out this algorithm as a candidate for the Pareto frontier. We also extend our algorithm and analysis to a more general problem than online portfolio selection, viz. online learning of quantum states with log loss. This algorithm, called SCHRÖDINGER’S-BISONS, is the first efficient algorithm with polylogarithmic regret for this more general problem. © 2022 J. Zimmert, N. Agarwal & S. Kale.},

We demonstrate that the data-driven approach is capable of learning an adaptive asset allocation strategy directly from historical market returns, without assuming any parametric model of the financial market dynamics. The optimal adaptive strategy outperforms the benchmark constant proportion strategy, achieving a higher terminal wealth with a 90% probability, a 46% higher median terminal wealth, and a significantly more right-skewed terminal wealth distribution. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This paper talks about successful approach and enablers for development of in-house capability for transformation that lead to generating significant business value The digital transition can pose both challenges and opportunities in this transformation. ADNOC ONSHORE has developed an integrated framework to encourage and accelerate data science capabilities. This framework promotes a vision with collaborative, sustainable mechanisms to develop talent. It is not just the formal learning and additional professional qualification that make it possible to build this in house capability. There are five major areas are enabled this framework such as data science & analytics skills competency model, sustainable on-line collaborative learning program, organizational culture change, democratizing AI through open platform & a digital business model for performing real business problems/use case PoCs. Each area has a detailed program and execution strategy with a collaborative effort from technical and non-technical stakeholders. ADNOC ONSHORE has successfully implemented this framework and able to certify 20 employees as part of this program. The Data Science Competency Model identified and defined the skills required to be successful within the enterprise with a clear learning path and mentorship. The leadership played a pivotal role to encourage data driven decision making and predictive capabilities in addition to executive awareness to lead the change with clear performance indicators. By democratizing AI platform across upstream user community, six real business cases have been successfully developed with clear business value in subsurface and production workflows according to the defined digital business model. The successful business cases have improved efficiency by 75% in performing cement & corrosion log interpretation & well portfolio optimization. Data driven analytics have been evaluated in subsurface workflows such as infill location optimization, gas-lift candidate identification and they have complemented the existing techniques. The framework has been successfully extended to other group companies in ADNOC. The rapid growth of AI in business in the last five years presents an opportunity for oil and gas professionals for enhancing the skills and transformation. This paper talks about an integrated framework, learning path, democratizing AI, engagement of leadership, digital business model for business case evaluation by applying agile way of working and sustainable value creation.

The main objective of this research is to compare the Polish and German beta parameters of five Polish and three German sector indices using the Bayesian methodology in the period 2001-2020. The study has two detailed aims. First, to develop a modified, Bayesian approach (SBETA model) that generates significantly more precise beta than the traditional model. Second, to compare the results of different time-varying industry betas in the Polish and German economies, giving a simple investment recommendation, i.e., which sector could be classified as aggressive or defensive. The betas were time-varying in both markets but less persistent in the German industries, which seems characteristic of an advanced economy. The Banking sector betas were the highest in both markets, implying the aggressive nature of that industry in the last twenty years. For the Polish market industry, the betas of Construction, IT, Food and Drinks, and Telecom were classified as defensive. For the German economy, the Technologies (IT) sector was also classified as aggressive, but Telecom was defensive. The results give a valuable insight into the systematic risk levels in Poland and Germany, reflecting the investors' learning process and indicating that Polish Banking and German technologies outperformed the market in the last twenty years.  © by the author, licensee University of Lodz - Lodz University Press, Łódź, Poland.},

We try to integrate stock selection and portfolio optimization as a complete process to address this problem using hierarchical reinforcement learning. The high-level policy selects stocks with a high profitable probability, and then the low-level policy makes portfolio optimization on the selected stocks to gain more profit.

Using patent and R&D data, I show that firms with more technology spillover earn 7.7% higher annualized returns than firms with less technology spillover. Exploiting three quasi-natural experiments, I find that the return effect is strengthened (attenuated) when there is a plausibly exogenous increase (decrease) in the flow of technological information across firms. I also find that firms with more technology spillover have higher cash flow sensitivity to aggregate consumption, numbers of new products, and stock return synchronicity. These findings are consistent with models on learning about new technology; specifically, spillover enables learning about new technology to facilitate timely and large-scale adoption of new technology, which in turn exposes spillover recipients to additional systematic risk. These findings highlight the influence of innovation externality on stock returns. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Price prediction is essential in financial market research, as it is often used as a primary component for trading strategy or portfolio management specialisations. As these strategies rely on more than one future prediction point, the accuracy of a multi-horizon forecast is very important. Classical models, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), are not very good at multi-horizon forecasting. Also, current approaches employing deep learning do not usually factor in the heteroscedasticity of financial market time series. We introduce the similarity embedded temporal transformer (SeTT) algorithm by extending the state-of-the-art temporal transformer architecture with time series forecasting and statistical principles. We employ similarity vectors generated from historical trends across different financial instruments that are used to adjust the weight of the temporal transformer model during the training process. We conducted independent experiments across two time frames with volatile extrapolation periods using 20 companies from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Combining the psycholinguistics theory of the concreteness effect with asset-pricing theory, we determine that linguistic specificity in the management discussion and analysis section of a firm's annual reports is negatively associated with stock price synchronicity, particularly in firms with strong external information demand or insufficient information supply. Furthermore, only specificity of the review section leads to a reduction in stock price synchronicity. Mechanism tests show that specificity reduces information processing costs and enhances information credibility. Additionally, proprietary costs are an essential determinant of linguistic specificity adoption.

Product portfolio management (PPM) is a dynamic process by which an enterprise chooses which products to develop, sell, maintain, and remove to achieve strategic objectives, maximize profit, and balance markets for different capabilities. Most product portfolios involve new products only and exclude existing products. This study proposes a product/market portfolio model that considers both old/new products and old/new markets to maximize overall PPM profit, determine which old products should stay in existing markets, which new markets should be considered, or which markets should be abandoned, and develop new products for old markets or to introduce new products to some new markets. This study uses machine learning and deep learning algorithms to establish prediction models to screen the planned products and markets with a high success rate. Mathematical programming is then used to determine which old products should be sold in which old and new markets and which new products should be launched in which new and old markets to maximize profit. A sensitivity analysis is used to determine the effect of changes in the resource and the risk threshold on profit and product/market selection. © 2022 The Author(s).

We define a market state with recurrent neural network (RNN) volatility predictions and construct an investment strategy that dynamically combines equity, cash, and safe havens. The equity is allocated by targeting the volatility, and investing in safe havens depends on the predicted market state. We consider the S&P500 index with 13 safe haven assets, such as long-term government bonds, commodities, gold, and other precious metals. Other indices, NIKKEI225, NIFTY50, and STOXX50, are examined for robustness. With analysis conducted over a 20-year sample period, we find that RNN delivers sound predictions to construct the volatility targeting strategy. Among considered assets, only long-term Treasury bonds act as a safe haven and improve the strategy performance. Other considered assets have no such potential.

	abstract = {Rapid technological developments in the last decade have contributed to using machine learning (ML) in various economic sectors. Financial institutions have embraced technology and have applied ML algorithms in trading, portfolio management, and investment advising. Large-scale automation capabilities and cost savings make the ML algorithms attractive for personal and corporate finance applications. Using ML applications in finance raises ethical issues that need to be carefully examined. We engage a group of experts in finance and ethics to evaluate the relationship between ethical principles of finance and ML. The paper compares the experts’ findings with the results obtained using natural language processing (NLP) transformer models, given their ability to capture the semantic text similarity. The results reveal that the finance principles of integrity and fairness have the most significant relationships with ML ethics. The study includes a use case with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Microsoft Responsible AI Widgets explainability tools for error analysis and visualization of ML models. It analyzes credit card approval data and demonstrates that the explainability tools can address ethical issues in fintech, and improve transparency, thereby increasing the overall trustworthiness of ML models. The results show that both humans and machines could err in approving credit card requests despite using their best judgment based on the available information. Hence, human-machine collaboration could contribute to improved decision-making in finance. We propose a conceptual framework for addressing ethical challenges in fintech such as bias, discrimination, differential pricing, conflict of interest, and data protection. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Due to the non-negative constraints explicitly enforced, the extracted eigenvectors turn to be sparse without employing any sparsity controlling parameter. Accordingly, only one parameter has to be tuned, i.e., the learning rate. Also, the complexity of the method under study is approximately linear under plausible assumptions. To assess the method's performance, comprehensive experimental evaluation is conducted on both image and financial data. The proposed method is thoroughly compared to state-of-the-art and yields promising experimental findings.  © 2017 IEEE.},

The current system includes real estate calculations without the necessary forecasts for future market trends and inflation. The housing market is one of the most competitive in terms of pricing and the same has varied greatly in terms of many factors. Asset pricing is an important factor in decision-making for both buyers and investors in supporting budget allocation, acquisition strategies and deciding on the best plans as a result, it is one of the most important areas in which machine learning ideas can be used to maximize and accurately anticipate prices. As a result, in this paper, we present the different significant factors that we employ to accurately anticipate property values. To reduce residual errors, we can utilize regression models with a range of characteristics. Some engineering aspects are required when employing features in the regression model for improved prediction. To improve model fit, a set of multi-regression elements or a polynomial regression (with a set of varying strengths in the elements) is frequently utilized. In these models, it is expected to be significantly affected by the slope of the spine used to reduce it. Therefore, it directs the best use of regression models over other strategies to maximize the effect. This paper's goal is to predict free hold prices for free hold consumers based on their budgets and goals. Prospective prices can be forecast by evaluating past market trends and price levels, as well as future developments. General Terms: The experiments revealed that random for-set and gradient boosted tresses work better with higher accuracy percentages and lower error values when compared to other machine learning techniques. When the experiment's results are compared to the expected outcomes, these algorithms perform well. © 2022 by the Shivesh Singh, Shaurya Singh, Sudeept Singh Yadav and Avneesh Kumar.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to shed light on the management choice between fair value and cost for investment property under IAS 40 in Europe. Using a multi-motivation approach, we explore what drives this choice across countries and across industries after ten years have passed from the first adoption of IAS 40. Following the theoretical framework developed by the accounting choice theory, we hypothesize that there are several classes of reasons possibly leading managers to commit to fair value: contractual efficiency motives, asset pricing incentives tied to information asymmetries, country institutional factors, and industry factors. In order to test these hypotheses, we select a sample of publicly-traded firms operating in the real estate, manufacturing and banking industries, and located in nine European countries where national pre-IFRS standards mandated either fair value or historical cost for investment property. We test our hypotheses running our model both on the full sample (real estate, manufacturing, and banking) and on a subsample that excludes real estate firms. We find that all the proposed rationales included in our model play a role in explaining the choice between fair value and cost. Particularly, with regard to asset pricing incentives, the ratio of market to book value, as a proxy for information asymmetries, has a negative association with fair value. As for contractual motives, firm size, as a proxy for political costs is negatively related with the choice of fair value, although the firm's reliance on debt (measured by leverage) seems not to affect the choice. Firms with a higher ratio of investment property over total assets are much more likely to opt for fair value than firms for which IAS 40 assets are less significant. Finally, the comparison of choices made by firms in our sample at the first adoption of IFRS in 2005 with those made after ten years provides evidence of a learning process. The fair value choice however appears to be strongly related to country institutional factors, particularly the development of capital markets and legal origin, with firms operating in countries where markets are more developed being more likely to choose fair value. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Accurate well top picking and reservoir property prediction plays crucial role for petroleum exploration and production. The task is traditionally done manually by geologists, and can be inconsistent and time-consuming. In addition, the work is difficult to normalize and standardize due to human bias. For unconventional resource plays with tens of thousands of wells, constructing geological models and algorithms can be a daunting task. Machine learning is an emerging technology that has been increasingly adopted in the energy industry. It can provide automated and accurate well top picking and reservoir property analysis. This paper utilizes a case study in the Belly River Formation (BRF) of Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) to discuss capabilities enabled by automated well top picking and reservoir property analysis. First, 70993 wells with GR curve covering ~100000 km2 of WCSB were filtered. Among them, 32510 coring wells help to determine boundaries of BRF. Second, several tops were manually picked as seeds for automated picking using Subsequent Dynamic Time Warping approach. After quality control and log normalization, automatic picks were promoted into new seeds for subsequent picking until all pickings were done. Finally, the distribution of the BRF were defined, and combining with logging curves, the variation law of reservoir properties (porosity, permeability, saturation, etc.) was analyzed. Automated well top picking algorithm natively handles log normalization issues and picks. It completed ~70000s wells top picks in about 100 hours on cross section and map view, which may take over 1000 hours using traditional manual picking methods. Moreover, after automated well top picking, reservoir properties can be predicted as a “one-mouse-click” exercise. What need to do is to ascertain the acquired reservoir properties according to the production practice and to determine the algorithms and formulas according to the regional geological features. This workflow greatly improves efficiencies of the comprehensive reservoir evaluation and reservoir geological modeling of the WCSB by orders of magnitude. Subsequently, combining automated well top picking and reservoir property analysis results and real-time data of oilfield production, the exploration and production sweet spot prediction of the BRF of the WCSB can be done. In conclusion, this efficient approach based on machine learning has been successfully applied to the potential assessment of petroleum resources in the BRF. The assessment results were used for petroleum reservoir exploration and production, oilfield development plan design, and portfolio management and optimization. Application of the method requires cooperation across different disciplines—data science and earth science. The interdisciplinary nature provides accurate prediction and design optimization for unconventional resources exploration and production.

	abstract = {In this work, we focus on the development of an AI technology to support decision making for people in leadership positions while facing uncertain environments. We demonstrate an efficient approach based on a stochastic inverse reinforcement leaning (IRL) algorithm constructed by hybridizing the conventional Max-entropy IRL and mixture density network (MDN) for the prediction of transition probability. We took the case study of American football, a sports game with stochastic environment, since the number of yards gainable on the next offence in real American football is usually uncertain during strategy planning and decision making. The expert data for IRL are built using the American football 2017 season data in National Football League (NFL). The American football simulation environment was built by training MDN using the annual NFL data to generate the state transition probability for IRL. Under the framework of Max-Entropy IRL, optimal strategy was successfully obtained through a learnt reward function by trial-and-error communication with the MDN environment. To precisely evaluate the validity of the learnt policy, we have conducted a risk-return analysis and revealed that the trained IRL agent showed higher return and lower risk than the expert data, indicating that it is possible for the proposed IRL algorithm to learn superior policy than the one derived directly from the expert teaching data. Decision-making in an uncertain environment is a general issue, ranging from business operation to management. Our work presented here will likely serve as a general framework for optimal business operation and risk management and contribute especially to the portfolio's optimization in the financial and energy trading market.  © 2022 Risa Takayanagi et al.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement Learning algorithms are widely applied in many diverse fields, including portfolio management. Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) framework proposed by Jiang et al. achieved portfolio management based on their deep reinforcement learning algorithm. In the implementation of EIIE framework, a neural network such as the Convolutional Neural Network is applied as the policy network, to uncover more patterns in the data. However, this network typology is inefficient due to its simple structure. To overcome the shortcoming of EIIE framework, this paper introduces a novel algorithm, the Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Ensemble Network (MDAEN) strategy, which consists of a features-attention module and an assets-attention module. The MDAEN applies different types of attention mechanisms to extract information from the assets. Having adopted the reinforcement learning framework from Jiang et al., the agent is able to process transactions through MDAEN in a market. In our portfolio establishment, Bitcoin together with eleven other cryptocurrencies is selected to validate the performance of MDAEN against seven traditional portfolio strategies and EIIE. The experimental result demonstrates the efficacy of our strategy outperforming all other strategies by at least 35% in profitability and at least 30% in Sharpe Ratio.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Index tracking aims to create a portfolio with a similar performance to the reference index using fewer stocks. Concerning index-tracking, the ability to map data sources in the form of investment return data, economics, or financial reports to predict investment return is essential. The promising method to accomplish it is deep learning. This study investigates the use of deep learning for portfolio index-tracking using LQ45 as the reference index. Autoencoder and Deep Neural Network are two Deep Learning techniques; Autoencoder is utilized for stock selection, and Deep Neural Network handles portfolio optimization index-tracking. Two weighting techniques are used to create a portfolio: the Correlation Coefficient and Equal-Weight. The result shows that portfolio index-tracking produced by this research has similar performance and even exceeds LQ45 performance, as demonstrated by the resulting error of less than 0.03. Finally, despite the risk of the index-tracking portfolio that is slightly higher than LQ45, however, the performance shown by the Deep Learning implementation is considered promising as, in some circumstances, the method shows lower error compared to other similar research. Therefore, it is then expected that the Deep Learning implementation is able to contribute significantly to optimize portfolio index-tracking, especially for LQ45. © 2022 IEEE.},

Based on the existing literature, this paper aims to develop less conservative portfolio models. When the assumption of normality for returns is not valid, higher-order moments have been demonstrated effective in improving portfolio performance. Hence, the worst-case mean-VaR optimization portfolio involving the higher-order moments is developed in this work. Additionally, the machine learning-based preselection is also designed and implemented for selecting risky assets to further overcome the potential conservatism.

However, financial markets are highly non-stationary, making applying machine learning to single time series data difficult. Therefore, analyzing the market from multiple financial instruments and predicting their relative relationships is important. In this study, we propose a novel method for constructing investment portfolios based on a ranking model using the Transformer architecture. The essential part of the proposed method is a Rank Transformer (RaT) that determines asset allocation by predicting the investment efficiency ranking of each financial instrument using features obtained from historical price data. We also design a loss function that aims to optimize both Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), a measure of ranking prediction performance, and investment returns. The proposed method is expected to apply deep learning to financial problems such as investment selection. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, computer experiments were conducted using data from the U.S. stock market and the foreign exchange market. The results suggest that the proposed method can achieve better performance than conventional methods on the Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return. We conclude that the proposed method can be expected to improve annualized return rate. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research is inspired by a real case study from a pump rental business company across the US. The company was looking to increase the utilization of its rental assets while, at the same time, keeping the cost of fleet mobilization as efficient as possible. However, decisions for asset movement between branches were largely arranged between individual branch managers on an as-needed basis. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose an improvement for the company's asset management practice by modeling an integrated decision tool which involves evaluation of several machine learning algorithms for demand prediction and mathematical optimization for a centrally-planned asset allocation. Findings: The authors found that a feed-forward neural network (FNN) model with single hidden layer is the best performing predictor for the company's intermittent product demand and the optimization model is proven to prescribe the most efficient asset allocation given the demand prediction from FNN model. Practical implications: The implementation of this new tool will close the gap between the company's current and desired future level of operational performance and consequently increase its competitiveness Originality/value: The results show a superior prediction performance by a feed-forward neural network model and an efficient allocation decision prescribed by the optimization model. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Quantitative investment construct signals through quantitative models and send buy and sell instructions with computer programs, which pursues to obtain stable income or excess return. Quantitative investment has a history of more than 30 years in overseas development, with stable investment performance, growing market size and shares, and has been recognized by more and more investors. Quantitative investment technology almost covers the whole process of investment, including quantitative stock selection, quantitative timing, stock index futures arbitrage, commodity futures arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, algorithmic trading, asset allocation, risk control and so on. In this paper, we mainly focus on building a quantitative model for stock selection based on a classical machine learning algorithm called lasso. We believe that the stock price is driven by some factors, and we construct several factors based on trading data, fundamental data and other data sets. Machine learning is an emerging research direction in the field of investment. Machine learning algorithms are popular for their high accuracy, strong learning ability and good noise resistance. In this paper, we mainly employ least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), which help us select the most important factors and make prediction for stock return simultaneously. We back-Test our strategy with the component stocks of the CSI Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 index and CSI small-cap 500 index. The results show that our factors, lasso prediction model and strategy perform well in stock selection.  © 2022 ACM.},

The Ghost bottleneck module can generate many Ghost feature maps, improving the ability of the network to extract information from the real-world market. Furthermore, the number of parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs) is reduced. We use the GXPT to realize Jiang et al.'s Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) framework. In the EIIE framework, GhostNet is adapted to implement Identical Independent Evaluators to evaluate the growth potential of each asset. In our experiments, we chose the Accumulated Portfolio Value (APV) and the Sharpe Ratio (SR) to assess the efficiency of our strategy in the back-test.

	abstract = {This paper examines the computational feasibility of the standard model of learning in economic theory. It is shown that the information update technique at the heart of this model is impossible to compute in all but the simplest scenarios. Specifically, using tools from theoretical machine learning, the paper first demonstrates that there is no polynomial implementation of the model unless the independence structure of variables in the data is publicly known. Next, it is shown that there cannot exist a polynomial algorithm to infer the independence structure; consequently, the overall learning problem does not have a polynomial implementation. Using the learning model when it is computationally infeasible carries risks, and some of these are explored in the latter part of the paper in the context of financial markets. Especially in rich, high-frequency environments, it implies discarding a lot of useful information, and this can lead to paradoxical outcomes in interactive game-theoretic situations. This is illustrated in a trading example where market prices can never reflect an informed trader’s information, no matter how many rounds of trade. The paper provides new theoretical motivation for the use of bounded rationality models in the study of financial asset pricing—the bound on rationality arising from the computational hardness in learning. © 2021 by the author.},

Estimates of the market price of risk get more precise as more observations are available. We formulate the problem as an optimization under partial information. The particular structure of the incentives makes the objective function not concave. Therefore, we solve the problem by combining the martingale method and a concavification procedure and we obtain the optimal wealth and the investment strategy.

The VIX is calculated using option prices for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and is expressed as a percentage. Taking into account that VIX only shows the implicit volatility of the S&P 500 for the next 30 days, the authors develop a model for a near-optimal state trying to avoid uncertainty and insufficient accuracy. The researchers are trying to make a contribution to the theory of socially responsible portfolio management. The developed approach allows potential investments to make decisions regarding such important topics as ethical investing, performance analysis, as well as sustainable investment strategies. The approach of this research allows to use deep probabilistic convolutional neural networks based on conditional variance as a linear function of errors with the aim of estimating and predicting the VIX. For this purpose, the use of technical indicators and economic indexes such as Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) VIX and S&P 500 is considered. The results of estimating and predicting the VIX with the proposed method indicate high precision and create a certainty in modeling to achieve the goals. © 2021 by the authors.

The MPM uses XGBoost to learn how to switch between two risk-based portfolio allocation strategies, the Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) and more classical Naïve Risk Parity (NRP). It is demonstrated that the MPM is able to successfully take advantage of the best characteristics of each strategy (the NRP's fast growth during market uptrends, and the HRP's protection against drawdowns during market turmoil). As a result, the MPM is shown to possess an excellent out-of-sample risk-reward profile, as measured by the Sharpe ratio, and in addition offers a high degree of interpretability of its asset allocation decisions.  © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Stochastic control problems with delay are challenging due to the path-dependent feature of the system and thus its intrinsic high dimensions. In this paper, we propose and systematically study deep neural network-based algorithms to solve stochastic control problems with delay features. Specifically, we employ neural networks for sequence modeling (e.g., recurrent neural networks such as long short-term memory) to parameterize the policy and optimize the objective function. The proposed algorithms are tested on three benchmark examples: a linear-quadratic problem, optimal consumption with fixed finite delay, and portfolio optimization with complete memory. Particularly, we notice that the architecture of recurrent neural networks naturally captures the path-dependent feature with much flexibility and yields better performance with more efficient and stable training of the network compared to feedforward networks. The superiority is even evident in the case of portfolio optimization with complete memory, which features infinite delay. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

This is automatically done through curating and subsequently converting large-scale news data into portfolio management decisions. They train a machine learning news data classifier to automatically identify sev-eral key ESG issues in news data over time. They then aggregate these issues over time to generate a views vector under the Black–Litterman portfolio framework and finally compare the performance of an ESG-tilted portfolio against a standard Black–Litterman portfolio. They also show how this can be achieved at scale, in a fully automated manner, and with consistency over large periods of time. Their methodology thus demonstrates a reasonable and agile method for asset managers to incorporate ESG considerations into their portfolios free of any exclusionary frameworks and without sacrificing performance. © 2021 With Intelligence Ltd.},

However, little analysis is done at the micro level to examine the choices made by agents for forecasting rules. This paper explores one of these recent models from the standpoint of micro agent behavior. It is shown that at the fitted forecasting rules, agents would prefer deviating to other nearby rules. The simple two type model is then compared with several multi-type models allowing for agents to use a broader set of rules. This can impact the dynamics of the generated time series, but it also may not if one takes the parameter estimates of the original model as an exogenous restriction on a reasonable support for the forecasting rules. This result emphasizes that these models may be imposing some hidden micro assumptions about agent behavior. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

People are concerned about how to fully utilize these data to investigate the securities market's law. In the financial field, financial asset pricing is a major issue. To some extent, the size of the return is determined by the difference between asset prices and their intrinsic value. The total global investment scale of quantitative funds will surpass 20 billion yuan by the end of 2021. Global asset management firms have turned to quantitative funds as their most important investment tool. Quantitative investment applies a specific investment idea to a specific model by creating specific indicators and parameters and then executes the investment strategy, greatly increasing the breadth and depth of investment. The goal of investors is to understand risk and maximize returns on investment. Researchers and investors alike value quantitative investment because of its scientific and efficient operation. In quantitative stock selection, a multifactor stock selection model is a critical tool for building a portfolio. This paper builds a multifactor investment strategy based on the relevant factors of corporate finance and valuation, selects the portfolio, and calculates the excess return using a machine learning classification algorithm.  © 2022 Kefu Yi.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised ensemble learning or consensus clustering has gained popularity due to its ability to combine multiple clustering solutions into a single solution that is robust and often performs better than the individual ones. There have been several approaches to consensus clustering including voting and weighted voting algorithmic schemes. Although there have been several algorithms for adjusting the weights of a consensus clustering all of them are tuned based on some performance characteristic associated with clustering accuracy. In this paper, we propose a method for incorporating weights by taking into consideration the intra algorithmic variability i.e. algorithms that provide solutions with very different performance upon multiple runs. The methodology is inspired by modern portfolio theory and more specifically from Markowitz model for asset allocation where one is trying to identify the most efficient portfolio through the solution of a convex optimization problem. Here, efficiency is defined as the minimum amount of risk for an expected return. We apply this method to different datasets and compare with respect to performance and robustness. The proposed scheme appears to achieve competitive average performance with very low variability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Following this revolution, the present research aims to shed light on deep learning models in stocks analysis and apply theses analyses in portfolio management. To this end, we introduced a novel hybrid deep learning model for stock prediction and incorporated these predictions as investors’ views in Black-Litterman asset allocation model. The finding indicates that the Black-Litterman portfolio based on the predictions of the hybrid CEEMD-CNN-LSTM model constructed portfolios with high return, low extreme allocation, and low risk. Furthermore, the Black-Litterman portfolios based on the introduced prediction model outperformed the mean-variance portfolio, equal-weighted portfolio, and the Black-Litterman portfolios based on the predictions of CNN-LSTM and LSTM.

It relies on the construction of a measure capturing the level of discussion complexity between the Fed Chair and reporters during the Q&A sessions. I show that complex discussions are associated with higher equity returns and a drop in realized volatility. The method creates an attention score by quantifying how much the Chair needs to rely on reading internal documents to be able to answer a question. This is accomplished by building a novel dataset of video images of the press conferences and leveraging recent deep learning algorithms from computer vision. This alternative data provides new information on nonverbal communication that cannot be extracted from the widely analyzed FOMC transcripts.

We find strong evidence that OWL-based portfolio strategies outperform other benchmark strategies in the literature when stocks exhibit strong correlations. In particular, the OWL shrinkage method bridges the gap between the naive (but well performing) 1/N portfolio strategy and the portfolio optimization framework: our OWL-based portfolio strategies yield very similar portfolio weights to (yet not the same as) the 1/N portfolio strategy, but outperform the 1/N portfolio strategy in terms of both the Sharpe ratio and turnovers. We also show that the superior performance in Sharpe ratio against the 1/N portfolio is significant. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper tests a multi-factor asset pricing model that does not assume that the return's beta coefficients are constants. This is done by estimating the generalized arbitrage pricing theory (GAPT) using price differences. An implication of the GAPT is that when using price differences instead of returns, the beta coefficients are constant. We employ the adaptive multi-factor (AMF) model to test the GAPT utilizing a Groupwise Interpretable Basis Selection (GIBS) algorithm to identify the relevant factors from among all traded exchange-traded funds. We compare the performance of the AMF model with the Fama-French 5-factor (FF5) model. For nearly all time periods less than six years, the beta coefficients are time-invariant for the AMF model, but not for the FF5 model. This implies that the AMF model with a rolling window (such as five years) is more consistent with realized asset returns than is the FF5 model.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Asset pricing model is the pillar of modern financial market price theory. It is of great practical and theoretical significance to solve the equilibrium price-dividend function of the asset pricing model. To solve the asset pricing model, this paper develops a novel neural network method called improved trigonometric neural network, which consists of three parts: the improved trigonometric function, the initial-condition extreme learning machine algorithm and the reduction algorithm. First, the equilibrium price-dividend function is described as a stochastic differential equation and this function is translated into a second-order ordinary differential equation equivalently. Second, the improved trigonometric neural network is used to solve the differential equation with initial conditions, where the improved trigonometric function is used to serve as the activation function. The reduction algorithm is proposed to obtain a simpler network structure and a faster computing speed. Third, numerical experiments of the improved trigonometric neural network show that the numerical solution of the price-dividend function will be obtained precisely, quickly and feasibly. Compared with several methods to solve asset pricing model, the improved trigonometric neural network has the highest accuracy and fastest speed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide a novel portfolio asset prediction by means of the modified deep learning and hybrid meta-heuristic concept. In the past few years, portfolio optimization has appeared as a demanding and fascinating multi-objective problem, in the area of computational finance. Yet, it is accepting the growing attention of fund management companies, researchers and individual investors. The primary issues in portfolio selection are the choice of a subset of assets and its related optimal weights of every chosen asset. The composition of every asset is chosen in a manner such that the total profit or return of the portfolio is improved thereby reducing the risk at the same time. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a novel portfolio asset prediction using the modified deep learning concept. For implementing this framework, a set of data involving the portfolio details of different companies for certain duration is selected. The proposed model involves two main phases. One is to predict the future state or profit of every company, and the other is to select the company which is giving maximum profit in the future. In the first phase, a deep learning model called recurrent neural network (RNN) is used for predicting the future condition of the entire companies taken in the data set and thus creates the data library. Once the forecasting of the data is done, the selection of companies for the portfolio is done using a hybrid optimization algorithm by integrating Jaya algorithm (JA) and spotted hyena optimization (SHO) termed as Jaya-based spotted hyena optimization (J-SHO). This optimization model tries to get the optimal solution including which company has to be selected, and optimized RNN helps to predict the future return while using those companies. The main objective model of the J-SHO-based RNN is to maximize the prediction accuracy and J-SHO-based portfolio asset selection is to maximize the profit. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets from real-world stock markets with diverse assets in various time periods shows that the developed model outperforms other state-of-the-art strategies proving its efficiency in portfolio optimization. Findings: From the analysis, the profit analysis of proposed J-SHO for predicting after 7 days in next month was 46.15% better than particle swarm optimization (PSO), 18.75% better than grey wolf optimization (GWO), 35.71% better than whale optimization algorithm (WOA), 5.56% superior to JA and 35.71% superior to SHO. Therefore, it can be certified that the proposed J-SHO was effective in providing intelligent portfolio asset selection and prediction when compared with the conventional methods. Originality/value: This paper presents a technique for providing a novel portfolio asset prediction using J-SHO algorithm. This is the first work uses J-SHO-based optimization for providing a novel portfolio asset prediction using the modified deep learning concept. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Trend following strategies are well-known to exhibit excellent excess return performance across a wide range of asset classes in various global markets. For the equity asset class in particular, while the securities selection part is relatively a straightforward procedure, the weight allocation part is more debatable and it has traditionally been identified with the equal-weighted allocation strategy. In this paper, we examine security’s own return-based weight allocation strategy for trend following investing and find that this strategy generates superior returns to several well-established weight allocation schemes. In particular, if the true return of the holding period is used ex ante for weight allocation, it is found that this strategy can generate absolutely huge excess returns. Motivated by this finding, we investigate the efficacy of machine learning techniques for regression of securities’ returns to improve the weight calculation in this framework. Empirical results indicate that deep learning provides the means of regression with which largest excess return gains are possible. In particular, it is demonstrated that the return-based weight allocation strategy defined by our proposed deep learning architecture produces substantial abnormal returns outperforming all other broadly recognised weight allocation schemes compared in this paper. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Project Portfolio Management is relevant for the growth of companies since it favors planning. Project Portfolio Management manages the resources to plan, control, and execute projects and obtain the strategic objectives of the organizations. In Project Portfolio Management, a large amount of data is forged, important for planning new projects in companies; therefore, the need arises to create models that help process and interpret the data. In this context, Machine Learning is presented as a technological enabler that allows a system, by itself and in an automated way, to learn to discover trends, patterns, and relationships between data; it is an engine of digital transformation of business and that organizations are embracing. Therefore, this article aims to compile and review proposals made to implement machine learning in the management of the project portfolio and apply algorithms that allow the development of models that help in the management and evaluation of projects to be developed in a Software Factory. The CRISP-DM methodology is applied to process the data of costs, times, and types of Projects; the Python programming language is used, the dataset corresponds to a Software Factory. The results validate the models implemented using Machine Learning algorithms, such as regression and decision trees, and thereby obtain the best model for predictions, establishing the correlation between variables and the benefit to be achieved. It is concluded, the implementation of Machine Learning improves the IT Project Portfolio Management, helping to identify which projects are more profitable and beneficial.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic asset allocation is an emerging field of study. Total return, the common performance metric, is useful for comparing algorithms but does not help us determine how close an RL algorithm is to an optimal solution. In real-world financial applications, a bad decision could prove to be fatal. One of the key ideas of our work is to combine the two paradigms of the mean-variance optimization approach (Markowitz criteria) and the optimal capital growth approach (Kelly criteria) via the actor-critic approach. By using an actor-critic approach, we can balance optimization of risk and growth by configuring the actor to optimize the mean-variance while the critic is configured to maximize growth. We propose a Geometric Policy Score used by the critic to assess the quality of the actions taken by the actor. This could allow portfolio manager practitioners to better understand the investment RL policy. We present an extensive and in-depth study of RL algorithms for use in portfolio management (PM). We studied eight published policy-based RL algorithms which are preferred over value-based RL because they are better suited for continuous action spaces and are considered to be state of the art, Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG), Stochastic Policy Gradients (SPG), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and Evolution Strategies (ES) for Policy Optimization. We implemented all eight and we were able to modify all of them for PM but our initial testing determined that their performance was not satisfactory. Most algorithms showed difficulty converging during the training process due to the non-stationary and noisy nature of financial environments, along with other challenges. We selected the four most promising algorithms DPG, SPG, DDPG, PPO for further improvements. The modification of RL algorithms to finance required unconventional changes. We have developed a novel approach for encoding multi-type financial data in a way that is compatible with RL. We use a multi-channel convolutional neural network (CNN-RL) framework, where each channel corresponds to a specific type of data such as high-low-open-close prices and volumes. We also designed a reward function based on concepts such as alpha, beta, and diversification that are financially meaningful while still being learnable by RL. In addition, portfolio managers will typically use a blend of time series analysis and cross-sectional analysis before making a decision. We extend our approach to incorporate, for the first time, cross-sectional deep RL in addition to time series RL. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the RL agents and benchmark them against commonly used passive and active trading strategies, such as the uniform buy-and-hold (UBAH) index and the dynamical multi-period Mean-Variance-Optimization (MVO) model. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In doing so, we test various machine learning models and find that, while all models outperform a random classifier, recurrent neural networks and gradient boosting classifiers are especially well-suited for the examined prediction tasks. We use a comprehensive feature set, including technical, blockchain-based, sentiment-/interest-based, and asset-based features. Our results show that technical features remain most relevant for most methods, followed by selected blockchain-based and sentiment-/interest-based features. Additionally, we find that predictability increases for longer prediction horizons. Although a quantile-based long-short trading strategy generates monthly returns of up to 39% before transaction costs, it leads to negative returns after taking transaction costs into account due to the particularly short holding periods. © 2021 The Authors},

For this purpose, a wide variety of GARCH-type models have been employed. However, there is no consensus in the literature on which specification arising from the volatility equation and the assumed error distribution is better in an out-of-sample performance. This study tries to fill this gap by comparing the forecasting performances of 110 GARCH-type models for Bitcoin volatility. Furthermore, it proposes a new combining method based on support vector machines (SVM). This method effectively selects the set of superior models to perform meta-learning. The results indicate that the best performing GARCH specification depends on the loss function chosen, and the proposed method leads to more accurate volatility forecasts than those of the best GARCH-type models and other combining methods investigated. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

To address these issues, we introduce the Contextual Budgeting System (CBS ), a budget allocation framework using a multi-agent system of contextual and continuous Multi-Armed Bandits. Our proposed solution decomposes the problem into a convex optimization problem whose objective is drawn using Thompson Sampling. In order to efficiently deal with context and cold-start, we propose a transfer learning mechanism using supervised learning methods that augment simple parametric models. We apply an implementation of this algorithm to all spending for new driver acquisition at Lyft and measure a (22 ± 10)% improvement in the mean Cost Per user Acquisition (CPA) over a previous non-contextual model, based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo, generating tens of millions of dollars annually in efficiency improvements while also increasing total user acquisition. © 2021 ACM.},

Unlike road networks, financial networks are neither given nor static, posing significant challenges in learning meaningful networks and promoting their applications in price prediction. In this paper, we first apply the attention mechanism to connect the "dots"(firms) and learn dynamic network structures among stocks over time. Next, the end-to-end graph neural networks pipeline diffuses and propagates the firms' accounting fundamentals into the learned networks and ultimately predicts stock future returns. The proposed model reduces the prediction errors by 6% compared to the state-of-the-art models. Our results are robust with different assessment measures. We also show that portfolios based on our model outperform the S&P-500 index by 34% in terms of Sharpe Ratio, suggesting that our model is better at capturing the dynamic inter-connection among firms and identifying stocks with fast recovery from major events. Further investigation on the learned networks reveals that the network structure aligns closely with the market conditions. Finally, with an ablation study, we investigate different alternative versions of our model and the contribution of each component. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {The ability to leverage data science can generate valuable insights and actions in organisations by enhancing data-driven decision-making to find optimal solutions based on complex business parameters and data. However, only a small percentage of the organisations can successfully obtain a business value from their investments due to a lack of organisational management, alignment, and culture. Becoming a data-driven organisation requires an organisational change that should be managed and fostered from a holistic multidisciplinary perspective. Accordingly, this study seeks to address these problems by developing the Data Drivenness Process Capability Determination Model (DDPCDM) based on the ISO/IEC 330xx family of standards. The proposed model enables organisations to determine their current management capabilities, derivation of a gap analysis, and the creation of a comprehensive roadmap for improvement in a structured and standardised way. DDPCDM comprises two main dimensions: process and capability. The process dimension consists of five organisational management processes: change management, skill and talent management, strategic alignment, organisational learning, and sponsorship and portfolio management. The capability dimension embraces six levels, from incomplete to innovating. The applicability and usability of DDPCDM are also evaluated by conducting a multiple-case study in two organisations. The results reveal that the proposed model is able to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of an organisation in adopting, managing, and fostering the transition to a data-driven organisation and providing a roadmap for continuously improving the data-drivenness of organisations. © 2021 The Authors.

Similarly, we test whether sampling historical return data through learning modules influences long-term decision making regarding asset allocation within a retirement portfolio. or $1 in a hypothetical lottery. Similarly, we test whether sampling historical return data through learning modules influences long-term decision making regarding asset allocation within a retirement portfolio. Findings: Allowing participants to experience the underlying probability through sampling significantly influences behavior, as participants were more likely to select the ambiguous option after sampling. Here, we also find that participants who receive interactive learning modules – which require users to manually alter the asset allocation to produce a sample of historical return data based on the specific allocation entered in the model – increase their post-learning equity allocations by 10.1% more than individuals receiving static modules. Interestingly, we find no significant evidence of ambiguity aversion playing a role in the asset allocation decision. Originality/value: We find that decision-making related to ambiguous and risky options can be substantially influenced by experiential learning. Our study supplements previous literature, providing a link between research on the effect of ambiguity on stock market participation and implementation of educational programs to improve the asset allocation decision for young adults. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We find that, for short investment horizons, participants coordinate on self-fulfilling trend-extrapolating predictions. Price deviations are then reinforced and amplified, possibly leading to large bubbles and crashes in asset prices. For longer investment horizons such bubbles do not emerge and price volatility tends to be lower. This is due to the fact that, for longer horizons, there is more dispersion in participants’ forecasts, and participants extrapolate trends in past prices to a lesser extent. We also show that, independent of the investment horizon, if the initial history of asset prices is already relatively stable before participants start their prediction task, price volatility remains small, with prices close to their fundamental values for the duration of the experiment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {An investment in a portfolio can not only guarantee returns but can also effectively control risk factors. Portfolio optimization is a multi-objective optimization problem. In order to better assist a decision maker to obtain his/her preferred investment solution, an interactive multi-criterion decision making system (MV-IMCDM) is designed for the Mean-Variance (MV) model of the portfolio optimization problem. Considering the flexibility requirement of a preference model that provides a guiding role in MV-IMCDM, a self-learning based preference model DT-PM (decision tree-preference model) is constructed. Compared with the present function based preference model, the DT-PM fully considers a decision maker’s bounded rationality. It does not require an assumption that the decision maker’s preference structure and preference change are known a priori and can be automatically generated and completely updated by learning from the decision maker’s preference feedback. Experimental results of a comparison show that, in the case that the decision maker’s preference structure and preference change are unknown a priori, the performances of guidance and fitness of the DT-PM are remarkably superior to function based preference models; in the case that the decision maker’s preference structure is known a priori, the performances of guidance and fitness of the DT-PM is approximated to the predefined function based model. It can be concluded that the DT-PM can agree with the preference ambiguity and the variability of a decision maker with bounded rationality and be applied more widely in a real decision system. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Portfolio management aims at maximizing the return on investment while minimizing risk by continuously reallocating the assets forming the portfolio. These assets are not independent but correlated during a short time period. A graph convolutional reinforcement learning framework called DeepPocket is proposed whose objective is to exploit the time-varying interrelations between financial instruments. These interrelations are represented by a graph whose nodes correspond to the financial instruments while the edges correspond to a pair-wise correlation function in between assets. DeepPocket consists of a restricted, stacked autoencoder for feature extraction, a convolutional network to collect underlying local information shared among financial instruments and an actor-critic reinforcement learning agent. The actor-critic structure contains two convolutional networks in which the actor learns and enforces an investment policy which is, in turn, evaluated by the critic in order to determine the best course of action by constantly reallocating the various portfolio assets to optimize the expected return on investment. The agent is initially trained offline with online stochastic batching on historical data. As new data become available, it is trained online with a passive concept drift approach to handle unexpected changes in their distributions. DeepPocket is evaluated against five real-life datasets over three distinct investment periods, including during the Covid-19 crisis, and clearly outperformed market indexes. © 2021},

A major drawback is that the tangency portfolios constructed by using the existing portfolio risk measures such as portfolio standard deviation, value-at-risk (VaR), conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), maximum absolute deviation (MAD) are always affected by the larger skewness and kurtosis of the portfolio return. This paper develops a set of metrics that extend the traditional portfolio Sharpe ratio (PSR) to measures that include skewness and kurtosis. Using a random portfolio approach, the paper demonstrates how to use these new metrics and optimize portfolios. Inclusion of higher moments such as skewness and kurtosis in portfolio risk management acknowledges the risk of asymmetric and heavy-tailed returns and can help in constructing resilient portfolios. For portfolio optimization, simple yet effective novel data-driven resilient portfolio risk measures incorporating skewness and kurtosis are presented in this paper. The results show that the performance of maximum mean-risk portfolios using the proposed portfolio risk measures based on volatility correlation and sign correlation outperform the commonly used tangency portfolio using portfolio standard deviation. © 2021 IEEE.},

In contrast with most of the existing approaches, our framework performs forecast selection and combination in one step, allowing for potentially sparse combining schemes. Moreover, by exploiting the analogy between forecasts combination and portfolio optimization, we provide the analytical expression of the optimal penalty strength when penalizing with the L2-divergence from the equally-weighted scheme. An extensive simulation study and two empirical applications allow us to investigate the impact of the divergence function, the reference scheme, and the non-negativity constraint on the predictive performance.

	abstract = {Index tracking portfolio optimization is popular form of passive investment strategy, with a steady and profitable performance compared to an active investment strategy. Due to the revival of deep learning in recent years, several studies have been conducted to apply deep learning in the field of finance. However, most studies use deep learning exclusively to predict stock price movement, not to optimize the portfolio directly. We propose a deep learning framework to optimize the index-tracking portfolio and overcome this limitation. We use the output distribution of the softmax layer from the fixed noise as the portfolio weights and verify the tracking performance of the proposed method on the S&P 500 index. Furthermore, by performing the ablation studies on the training-validation dataset split ratio and data normalization, we demonstrate that these are critical parameters for applying deep learning to the portfolio optimization problem. We also verify the generalization performance of the proposed method through additional experiments with another index of a major stock market, the Hang Seng Index (HSI). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The separable convex resource allocation problem with nested bound constraints aims to allocate B units of resources to n activities to minimize a separable convex cost function, with lower and upper bounds on the total amount of resources that can be consumed by nested subsets of activities. We develop a new combinatorial algorithm to solve this model exactly. Our algorithm is capable of solving instances with millions of activities in several minutes. The running time of our algorithm is at most 73% of the running time of the current best algorithm for benchmark instances with three classes of convex objectives. The efficiency of our algorithm derives from a combination of constraint relaxation and divide and conquer based on infeasibility information. In particular, nested bound constraints are relaxed first; if the solution obtained violates some bound constraints, we show that the problem can be divided into two subproblems of the same structure and smaller sizes according to the bound constraint with the largest violation. Summary of Contribution. The resource allocation problem is a collection of optimization models with a wide range of applications in production planning, logistics, portfolio management, telecommunications, statistical surveys, and machine learning. This paper studies the resource allocation model with prescribed lower and upper bounds on the total amount of resources consumed by nested subsets of activities. These nested bound constraints are motivated by storage limits, time-window requirements, and budget constraints in various applications. The model also appears as a subproblem in models for green logistics and machine learning, and it has to be solved repeatedly. The model belongs to the class of computationally challenging convex mixed-integer nonlinear programs. We develop a combinatorial algorithm to solve this model exactly. Our algorithm is faster than the algorithm that currently has the best theoretical complexity in the literature on an extensive set of test instances. The efficiency of our algorithm derives from the combination of an infeasibility-guided divide-and-conquer framework and a scaling-based greedy subroutine for resource allocation with submodular constraints. This paper also showcases the prevalent mismatch between the theoretical worst-case time complexity of an algorithm and its practical efficiency. We have offered some explanations of this mismatch through the perspectives of worst-case analysis, specially designed instances, and statistical metrics of numerical experiments. The implementation of our algorithm is available on an online repository. Copyright: © 2021 INFORMS},

	abstract = {The emerging cryptocurrency market has lately received great attention for asset allocation due to its decentralization uniqueness. However, its volatility and brand new trading mode has made it challenging to devising an acceptable automatically-generating strategy. This study proposes a framework for automatic high-frequency bitcoin transactions based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm — proximal policy optimization (PPO). The framework creatively regards the transaction process as actions, returns as awards and prices as states to align with the idea of reinforcement learning. It compares advanced machine learning-based models for static price predictions including support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Transformer by applying them to the real-time bitcoin price and the experimental results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms. Then an automatically-generating transaction strategy is constructed building on PPO with LSTM as the basis to construct the policy. Extensive empirical studies validate that the proposed method perform superiorly to various common trading strategy benchmarks for a single financial product. The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with synchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best benchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%. The proposed framework can earn excess returns through both the period of volatility and surge, which opens the door to research on building a single cryptocurrency trading strategy based on deep learning. Visualizations of trading the process show how the model handles high-frequency transactions to provide inspiration and demonstrate that it can be expanded to other financial products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting the volatility of financial asset prices and exploring its laws of movement have profound theoretical and practical guiding significance for financial market risk early warning, asset pricing, and investment portfolio design. The traditional methods are plagued by the problem of substandard prediction performance or gradient optimization. This paper proposes a novel volatility prediction method based on sparse multi-head attention (SP-M-Attention). This model discards the two-dimensional modeling strategy of time and space of the classic deep learning model. Instead, the solution is to embed a sparse multi-head attention calculation module in the network. The main advantages are that (i) it uses the inherent advantages of the multi-head attention mechanism to achieve parallel computing, (ii) it reduces the computational complexity through sparse measurements and feature compression of volatility, and (iii) it avoids the gradient problems caused by long-range propagation and therefore, is more suitable than traditional methods for the task of analysis of long time series. In the end, the article conducts an empirical study on the effectiveness of the proposed method through real datasets of major financial markets. Experimental results show that the prediction performance of the proposed model on all real datasets surpasses all benchmark models. This discovery will aid financial risk management and the optimization of investment strategies. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm has been widely used in algorithmic trading. Many fully automated trading systems or strategies have been built using DRL agents, which integrate price prediction and trading signal generation in one system. However, the previous agents extract the current state from the market data without considering the long-term market historical trend when making decisions. Besides, plenty of related and useful information has not been considered. To address these two problems, we propose a novel model named Parallel Multi-Module Deep Reinforcement Learning (PMMRL) algorithm. Here, two parallel modules are used to extract and encode the feature: one module employing Fully Connected (FC) layers is used to learn the current state from the market data of the traded stock and the fundamental data of the issuing company; another module using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers aims to detect the long-term historical trend of the market. The proposed model can extract features from the whole environment by the above two modules simultaneously, taking the advantages of both LSTM and FC layers. Extensive experiments on China stock market illustrate that the proposed PMMRL algorithm achieves a higher profit and a lower drawdown than several state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The results show that the machine learning algorithm can predict customers' asset allocation decision preference to a certain extent, and its performance is more effective than the traditional prediction method. Combined with the sample data, this paper analyzes the impact of venture capital on the growth ability of small and medium-sized enterprises, uses entropy method to evaluate corporate growth ability and corporate governance respectively, and further establishes a regression model to verify the intermediary role of corporate governance. The structured macro-prudential monetary policy rules with different response coefficients to the leverage ratio of different enterprises can effectively improve the level of social welfare, and the combination of optimal response coefficients is different under different kinds of shocks. Venture capital involvement in small and medium-sized enterprises can significantly improve the growth ability of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the support of venture capital can help enterprises improve the level of corporate governance. The experimental results show that the scorecard model constructed by the proposed method has good stability.

	abstract = {The Hipster Effect is a group of evolutionary ‘‘Diffusive Learning’’ processes of networks of individuals and groups (and their communication devices) that form Cyber-Physical Systems; and the Hipster Effect theory has potential applications in many fields of research. This study addresses decision-making parameters in machine-learning algorithms, and more specifically, critiques the explanations for the Hipster Effect, and discusses the implications for portfolio management and corporate bankruptcy prediction (two areas where AI has been used extensively). The methodological approach in this study is entirely theoretical analysis. The main findings are as follows: (i) the Hipster Effect theory and associated mathematical models are flawed; (ii) some decision-making and learning models in machine-learning algorithms are flawed; (iii) but regardless of whether or not the Hipster Effect theory is correct, it can be used to develop portfolio management models, some of which are summarised herein; (iv) the [1] corporate bankruptcy prediction model can also be used for portfolio-selection (stocks and bonds). © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in portfolio optimization using graphical LASSO (GL) machine learning method, by assuming normality for asset returns. However, a major drawback is that most of the asset returns follow non-normal distributions and sample percentiles are used to study the portfolio optimization with Value-at-Risk (VaR) as a risk measure. In this paper, a data-driven random weights algorithm (RWA) and a sign correlation based portfolio return distribution are used to study the fuzzy portfolio optimization. The superiority of RWA over the commonly used genetic algorithm (GA) in computing the optimal portfolio weights is demonstrated by comparing the computing time. When comparing the estimate of the risk tolerance coefficient and the theoretical value for tangency portfolios with volatility as a risk measure, RWA outperforms (smaller absolute error) the GA. The novelty of this paper is the use of RWA and GA to calculate the fuzzy estimates (interval estimates) of the risk tolerance coefficient/optimal weights and using the sign correlation to obtain the data-driven distribution of the portfolio returns. More specifically the novelty is to obtain the fuzzy estimates of the risk tolerance coefficient and portfolio weights by modelling the portfolio volatility as an asymmetric triangular fuzzy number from the data-driven observed portfolio volatilities. In particular, the proposed RWA as well as GA lead to machine learning solutions for the portfolio optimization problems without a closed form solution and provide fuzzy estimates of the risk tolerance coefficient and the optimal portfolio weights. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Liquidity risk arises from the inability to unwind or hedge trading positions at the prevailing market prices. The risk of liquidity is a wide and complex topic as it depends on several factors and causes. While much has been written on the subject, there exists no clear-cut mathematical description of the phenomena and typical market risk modeling methods fail to identify the effect of illiquidity risk. In this paper, we do not propose a definitive one either, but we attempt to derive novel mathematical algorithms for the dynamic modeling of trading volumes during the closeout period from the perspective of multiple-Asset portfolio(s), as well as for financial entities with different subsidiary firms and multiple agents. The robust modeling techniques are based on the application of initial-value-problem differential equations technique for portfolio selection and risk management purposes. This paper provides some crucial parameters for the assessment of the trading volumes of multiple-Asset portfolio(s) during the closeout period, where the mathematical proofs for each theorem and corollary are provided. Based on the new developed econophysics theory, this paper presents for the first time a closed-form solution for key parameters for the estimation of trading volumes and liquidity risk, such as the unwinding constant, half-life, and mean lifetime and discusses how these novel parameters can be estimated and incorporated into the proposed techniques. The developed modeling algorithms are appealing in terms of theory and are promising for practical econophysics applications, particularly in developing dynamic and robust portfolio management algorithms in light of the 2007-2009 global financial crunch. In addition, they can be applied to artificial intelligence and machine learning for the policymaking process, reinforcement machine learning techniques for the Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics, expert systems in finance, FinTech, and within big data ecosystems. © 2022 Mazin A.

Such a deterministic nature in ANNs causes the limitations of using ANNs for medical diagnosis, law problems, and portfolio management in which not only discovering the prediction but also the uncertainty of the prediction is essentially required. In order to address such a problem, we propose a predictive probabilistic neural network model, which corresponds to a different manner of using the generator in the conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) that has been routinely used for conditional sample genera-tion. By reversing the input and output of ordinary cGAN, the model can be successfully used as a predictive model; moreover, the model is robust against noises since adversarial training is employed. In addition, to measure the uncertainty of predictions, we introduce the entropy and relative entropy for regression problems and classification problems, respectively. The proposed framework is applied to stock market data and an image classification task. As a result, the proposed framework shows superior estimation performance, especially on noisy data; moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed framework can properly estimate the uncertainty of predictions. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of conditional asset allocation strategies is to overcome this issue by adjusting portfolio allocations to hedge changes in the investment opportunity set. This paper proposes a new approach to conditional asset allocation that is based on machine learning; it analyzes historical market states and asset returns and identifies the optimal portfolio choice in a new period when new observations become available. In this approach, we directly relate state variables to portfolio weights, rather than firstly modeling the return distribution and subsequently estimating the portfolio choice. The method captures nonlinearity among the state (predicting) variables and portfolio weights without assuming any particular distribution of returns and other data, without fitting a model with a fixed number of predicting variables to data and without estimating any parameters. The empirical results for a portfolio of stock and bond indices show the proposed approach generates a more efficient outcome compared to traditional methods and is robust in using different objective functions across different sample periods. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {This research presents a retail analytics application which uses machine learning (ML) to identify and predict under- and overperforming consumer packaged goods (CPGs) using retail scanner data. Essential to measuring market performance at the SKU level is the relationship between distribution and market share (the velocity curve). We validate that ML can reproduce the velocity curve, and ML is further used to predict underperforming, in-line performing, and overperforming SKUs relative to the velocity curve, based on a range of variables (SKU features) at a point in time. Our ML approach can correctly predict 83% of SKUs as under-, in-line-, or overperforming based on their characteristics. The research analyzes 9,321 SKUs of 2,565 brands across seven product categories of CPGs which were sold in 8,117 stores from 49 different retail chains of five different retail channels located in the US states of California, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin. The retail stores comprise convenience stores, drug stores, food stores, liquor stores, and mass merchandise retail stores. The data is Nielsen retail store scanner data for the calendar year 2014. The relationship between distribution and market share is a market-wide proxy for the ratio of relative sales in a category to, for example, aggregate shelf space, a key retail productivity metric. We further find indications that the distribution of SKUs across different store sizes, the stores’ category specialization, the line length of the brands, the overall performance of the parent brand, and sales consistency are the most important characteristics for the prediction of market share performance beyond the velocity curve. The methods and results presented will help CPG marketers (suppliers and retailers) understand which SKUs are under-, in-line-, or overperforming and the potential factors contributing to that performance. Optimizing assortments and portfolios is essential to decrease failure rates of individual SKUs. ML approaches can evolve to complementary support tools for such management problems. © 2021 New York University},

	abstract = {The project selection problem in an electric distribution utility, which is part of the network expansion planning task, requires a formal process of prioritizing some projects since the budget is limited. A complete solution to this problem, involving optimization and a decision-making model, is still a few explored in the literature. We proposed an integrated multicriteria decision-making methodology, including optimization and solutions ranking. The optimization module finds a set of Pareto-optimal portfolios, using the multi-objective genetic algorithm nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II to select and schedule the reinforcement projects in a multistage planning horizon. The proposed decision support module ranks the project portfolios based on Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART), considering the decision-maker profile embedded into the model by the Rank-Order Centroid (ROC) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) criteria weights. This paper tackles this methodology's theoretical foundations, taking into account some essential attributes, such as power quality and operational performance indexes, the number of consumers, and projects' financial impacts. We presented realistic case studies to show how portfolios are composed, not only when all nine attributes of projects are included in the optimization module, but also when the criteria weights are changed in the decision support module. This paper's main contribution lies in proposing a unique model to find optimal expansion plans and rank these project portfolios, considering the decision-maker profile adherent to its goals.

	abstract = {Identification of key determinants responsible for driving stock prices across the world is of paramount practical importance. The task is extremely arduous owing to sensitiveness of financial markets to macroeconomic shocks, external chaos, political instability and natural calamities. In this work, effort has been made to critically evaluate the influence of raw material prices, sectoral outlook, and market sentiment on stock prices at a granular level in the Indian context. The research resorts to wavelet analysis and machine learning models to estimate time varying dependence and explanatory capabilities of respective constructs. Wavelet coherence and correlation analyses have been conducted to decode the interaction bond of three determinants i.e., raw material prices, sectoral outlook, and market sentiment with stock prices of a sample set of Indian companies during short, medium, and long run scales. Boruta feature selection algorithm has been applied in conjunction with three dedicated machine learning approaches namely, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Genetic Algorithm for ranking the three features based on their explanatory capabilities across different time intervals. Overall findings suggest that the influence of respective features varied across different time horizons which can be leveraged for portfolio management. © 2021 The Authors},

The algorithmic trading strategy is developed from the perspective of a proprietary trading firm to maximize profit. A recurrent neural network-based Locational Marginal Price (LMP) spread forecast model is developed by leveraging the inter-hour dependencies of the market clearing algorithm. The LMP spread sensitivity with respect to net virtual bids is modeled as a monotonic function with the proposed constrained gradient boosting tree. We leverage the proposed algorithmic virtual bid trading strategy to evaluate both the profitability of the virtual bid portfolio and the efficiency of U.S. wholesale electricity markets. The comprehensive empirical analysis on PJM, ISO-NE, and CAISO indicates that the proposed virtual bid portfolio optimization strategy considering the price sensitivity explicitly outperforms the one that neglects the price sensitivity. The Sharpe ratio of virtual bid portfolios for all three electricity markets are much higher than that of the S&P 500 index. It was also shown that the efficiency of CAISO's two-settlement system is lower than that of PJM and ISO-NE.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Many real-world analytics problems involve two significant challenges: Prediction and optimization. Because of the typically complex nature of each challenge, the standard paradigm is predict-then-optimize. By and large, machine learning tools are intended to minimize prediction error and do not account for how the predictions will be used in the downstream optimization problem. In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart "Predict, then Optimize" (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization problem structure-that is, its objective and constraints-for designing better prediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function, which measures the decision error induced by a prediction. Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally challenging, and, thus, we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss function, which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+ loss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild conditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex, or even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical experiments on shortest-path and portfolio-optimization problems show that the SPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the predict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular, when the prediction model being trained is misspecified. We find that linear models trained using SPO+ loss tend to dominate random-forest algorithms, even when the ground truth is highly nonlinear. © 2022 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

	abstract = {Deep learning-based financial approaches have received attention from both investors and researchers. This study demonstrates how to optimize portfolios, asset allocation, and trading systems based on deep reinforcement learning using three frameworks. In the proposed deep learning structure, the input data are first decomposed through wavelet transformation (WT) to remove noise from stock price time-series data. Then, only the mother wavelet (high-frequency) data are used as input. Second, reinforcement learning is performed using the high-frequency data. The reinforcement learning network employs long short-term memory (LSTM). Actions are determined by the LSTM network or randomly. Third, it learns the optimal investment trading system using the actions of a given transaction and appropriate rewards. The structure of the optimal investment trading system obtained by the proposed deep reinforcement learning structure improves trading performance without requiring the construction of a predictive model. To investigate the performance of the proposed structure, we applied the S&P500, DJI, and KOSPI200 indices to the proposed structure (HW_LSTM_RL) and other reinforcement learning structures for comparison. We evaluated the difference in Sharpe ratio for various test periods (one to three years) and for different rewards. Using the decomposed high-frequency data as input, a portfolio of investment transactions was improved for highly volatile markets. In deep reinforcement learning, we found that network composition and appropriate rewards have significant influence on learning transactions in financial time-series data. Thus, the proposed HW_LSTM_RL structure demonstrates the importance of input data composition, learning network settings, and rewards. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

This is a particularly well-suited problem for reinforcement learning, as daily rewards are compounding and objective functions may include more than just profit, e.g., risk and sustainability. We developed a novel utility function with the Sharpe ratio representing risk and the environmental, social, and governance score (ESG) representing sustainability. We show that a state- of-the-art policy gradient method - multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradients (MADDPG) - fails to find the optimum policy due to flat policy gradients and we therefore replaced gradient descent with a genetic algorithm for parameter optimization. We show that our system outperforms MADDPG while improving on deep Q-learning approaches by allowing for continuous action spaces. Crucially, by incorporating risk and sustainability criteria in the utility function, we improve on the state-of-the-art in reinforcement learning for portfolio optimization; risk and sustainability are essential in any modern trading strategy, and we propose a system that does not merely report these metrics, but that actively optimizes the portfolio to improve on them.  © 2022 IEEE.},

They then apply a regime-based asset allocation to nominal risk parity strategy. Investors can further improve their investment performance by implementing a dollar-neutral factor momentum strategy as an overlay in conjunction with the core portfolio. The authors demonstrate that the time-series factor momentum strategy generates high risk-adjusted returns and exhibits pronounced defensive characteristics during market crashes. A volatility scaling approach is employed to manage the risk and further magnify the benefits of factor momentum. Empirical results suggest that the approach improves risk-adjusted returns by a substantial amount over the benchmark from both the standalone perspective and the contributory perspective. © 2021 With Intelligence Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Digital transformation (DT) is an increasingly relevant concept for businesses to remain competitive. As DT projects are disruptive to an organisation and are significantly different from traditional information technology projects, it is important to understand the value that specific DT projects will bring to an organisation before they are implemented, so that DT project portfolios can be optimally managed. Aim: This study aims to determine the key goals and benefits of DT projects, as well as the selection criteria for DT projects in South African businesses. The study also explores the most influential technologies for driving the implementation of DT projects. Setting: South Africa is an emerging economy. The study was performed in the initial phases of nationwide lockdown owing to COVID-19. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 leaders from South African businesses of varying sizes, but all in significant local markets. Content analysis using CAQDAS was used to analyse the primary data, using both inductive and deductive coding methods. Results: South African businesses use a combination of financial and non-financial project selection criteria across four main goals and benefit categories: customer experience, operational efficiency, business culture, and traditional project evaluation. The fifth proposed goal (new business models) was not used to evaluate DT projects. The most influential technologies that drive the selection of DT projects were data-related, such as data storage, data processing, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. Conclusion: Companies in South Africa can use traditional project evaluation criteria together with several new criteria to determine the value of DT projects more holistically. This study also suggests several key practical takeaways for businesses that are aspiring to implement their own DT projects. © 2022. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.},

	abstract = {Designing robust systems for precise prediction of future prices of stocks has always been considered a very challenging research problem. Even more challenging is to build a system for constructing an optimum portfolio of stocks based on the forecasted future stock prices. We present a deep learning-based regression model built on a long-and-short-term memory network (LSTM) network that automatically scraps the web and extracts historical stock prices based on a stock's ticker name for a specified pair of start and end dates, and forecasts the future stock prices. We deploy the model on 75 significant stocks chosen from 15 critical sectors of the Indian stock market. For each of the stocks, the model is evaluated for its forecast accuracy. Moreover, the predicted values of the stock prices are used as the basis for investment decisions, and the returns on the investments are computed. Extensive results are presented on the performance of the model. The analysis of the results demonstrates the efficacy and effectiveness of the system and enables us to compare the profitability of the sectors from the point of view of the investors in the stock market.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The study tries to estimate the returns using three known models, namely the single-index model, capital asset pricing model (CAPM), and arbitrage pricing theory (APT) model. The data for the study was taken from Nifty. The top 100 large-cap stocks were taken into account. The Nifty index was taken as the proxy for the market return. All data was taken with one period lag to make it stationary. These models are subjected to three software-based machine learning, namely decision tree, neural network, and ordinary least square. The results were iterated from the three best returns, and the area of the curve was estimated. The academic point score for the area was taken into consideration. The value 0.8 was taken as the cutoff for the acceptance of the model. The result shows that CAPM outperforms all the models used under different machine learning mechanisms. In the process, it was observed that the arbitrage pricing theory model too performs well. However, while we use the ordinary least square, the single-index model has the best performance. It is kind of a foregone conclusion since the single-index model is based on the return of stock and is close to paper trading. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

We compare three different techniques—mean-variance, HRP, and 1/N— for portfolio weight creation using returns of stocks from the S&P500 and STOXX600 for robustness.

	abstract = {Understanding the causal relations that drive markets is integral to both explaining past events and predicting future developments. Although there are various theories of economic causality, there has not yet been a wide adoption of machine learning–inspired causal frameworks within economics and finance. Causal networks are among the latter and provide one of the most transparent and practical models for representing the rela-tionships between economic causes and effects that are relevant for making investment decisions. Among the various approaches to causal networks, the noisy-or model stands out because it provides the formal means to simplify the calculation of the cumulative impact of more than one cause on an effect. One of the implicit assumptions of the noisy-or model is that the causal probability values posited by model builders are completely reli-able. This assumption is unrealistic, however, especially in financial applications in which beliefs about market events are generally supported by significantly less data relative to beliefs about natural phenomena. Moreover, aside from the need to evaluate the reliability of individual beliefs, portfolio managers presumably also need to assess the investment processes that produce those beliefs. To address the foregoing challenges, in this article, a formal, logic-based framework to produce robust, uncertainty-adjusted causal probability assignments within the noisy-or model is proposed. The robust noisy-or framework described provides both a technical enhancement of the basic noisy-or model and a practical solution for addressing the challenge posed by the varying quality of evidence that supports most investment decisions. © 2020 With Intelligence Ltd.},

	abstract = {Portfolio Optimization is a standard financial engineering problem. It aims for finding the best allocation of resources for a set of assets. This problem has been studied and different models have been proposed since the classical Mean-Variance model was introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952 and the later modified version by William Sharpe. The inclusion of real-life constraints to the problem has led to the introduction of the extended Mean-Variance model. However, the successes of nature-inspired algorithms in hard computational optimization problems have encouraged researchers to design and apply these algorithms for a variety of optimization problems. In this paper, we design and adapt a Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA) for the unconstrained and constrained portfolio optimization problems. SSA is a very recent swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the dynamic foraging behavior of flying squirrels. The proposed SSA metaheuristic approach is compared with a variety of approaches presented in the literature such as classical single metaheuristics, hybrid metaheuristic approaches and multi-objective optimization approaches for portfolio optimization. Comparative analysis and computational results using different performance indicators show the superiority of the proposed approach for the unconstrained portfolio optimization using both extended Mean-Variance and Sharpe models. For the constrained version of the problem, the proposed approach has also achieved highly competitive results for the different models adopted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Conservatism is the notorious problem of the worst-case robust portfolio optimization, and this issue has raised broad discussion in academia. To this end, we propose the hybrid robust portfolio models under ellipsoidal uncertainty sets in this paper, where both the best-case and the worst-case counterparts are involved. In the suggested models, we introduce a trade-off parameter to adjust the portfolio optimism level. Machine learning algorithms including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are used to evaluate the potential market movements and provide forecasting information to generate the hyperparameter for modeling. Additionally, we develop a clustering-based algorithm for properly constructing joint ellipsoidal uncertainty sets to reduce conservatism further. In the modeling phase, we design the hybrid portfolios based on variance (HRMV) and value at risk (VaR) and prove the equivalent relationship between the hybrid robust mean-VaR model (HRMVaR) and the hybrid robust mean-CVaR (conditional value at risk) according to the existing research. The US 12 industry portfolio data set retrieved from Kenneth R. French is employed for the in-sample and out-of-sample numerical experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed portfolios, where HRMV models have better Sharpe ratios and Calmar ratios than the corresponding nominal mean–variance model, and HRMVaR models outperform the baseline VaR-based portfolios in terms of returns. Sensitivity analysis supports the superiority of the joint ellipsoidal uncertainty set Uδ2, where the proposed portfolios constrained with Uδ2 show stable risk characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

To explain this inconsistency, this paper presents a model with “internally rational” agents who optimally update their subjective beliefs about stock prices.

	abstract = {The financial crisis in 2008 highlighted the demise of the most widely used risk measure, Value-at-Risk. Unlike the Basel-IV-required Conditional VaR model of Rockafellar & Uryasev, VaR ignores the possibility of abnormal returns and is not even coherent. Our novelty here is introducing an annual Desirability Value (DV) for each candidate company before creating a portfolio of their stocks. We utilize only the downside changes in DVs in CVaR-optimization instead of simply utilizing annual stock-price returns. The DV of a company is the perpendicular distance from the fundamental position of that company to the best separating hyperplane that separates profitable companies from losers during training. Thus, we introduce a novel coherent surrogate risk measure, Conditional-Desirability-Value-at-Risk (CDVaR). Our machine-learning-fundamental-analysis-based CDVaR portfolio optimization results are comparable to those of mainstream price-returns-based CVaR optimizers. We show that these two optimal portfolios and the market index, BIST100 (all three portfolios in USD terms), are cointegrated. When backtested using in-sample data, the resulting Mean-Reverting Portfolio, labelled MRP, returns an APR of 5.26 (in USD) over nine years. In contrast, the market index produces negative returns over the same period. Since the existence of cointegration points to a long-term trend, the fact that this conclusion comes from in-sample data seems to be acceptable. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

However, the models exhibit substantial variation in statistical predictive performance that translate into pronounced differences in economic profitability. The return and risk measures of long-only trading strategies indicate that machine learning models produce sizeable gains relative to our benchmark.

In this study, we propose a novel ensemble portfolio optimization (NEPO) framework utilized for broad commodity assets, which integrates a hybrid variational mode decomposition-bidirectional long short-term memory deep learning model for future returns forecast and a reinforcement learning-based model for optimizing the asset weight allocation. Our empirical results indicate that the NEPO framework could effectively improve the prediction accuracy and trend prediction ability across various commodity assets from different sectors. In addition, it could effectively incorporate Bitcoins into the asset pool and achieve better financial performance compared to traditional asset allocation strategies, commodity funds, and indices. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning-based portfolio management has recently attracted extensive attention. However, deep reinforcement learning methods are unexplainable and considered to be potentially risky, difficult to be trusted and regulated by users. To address these problems, we propose an eXplainable reinforcement learning framework for Portfolio Management, named XPM, which is efficient, concise, and can provide faithful explanations for network outputs. Specifically, we first design a policy network for portfolio management, which uses temporal convolutional network (TCN) to extract temporal features of multiple time series in portfolio. Then, we employ global average pooling (GAP) and a fully connected layer to integrate the global feature maps to handle asset correlations. Finally, we utilize softmax to determine the output portfolio weights. To assemble explainability into our model, we employ an explainable artificial intelligence method, class activation mapping (CAM), to explain the network outputs, which computes an activation map for an asset of interest. The map highlights the important assets and time intervals in the input state. In this way, end users can understand which part of the portfolio's recent price movements makes the network decision to invest in the target asset. Experimental results show that XPM outperforms the current state-of-the-art portfolio management methods in NASDAQ and NYSE markets, and can provide faithful and informative explanations to end users. © 2021 ACM.},

The tail risk measure peaks at stock market crashes, financial crises, political shocks and disaster events such as the coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, I find that tail risk is countercyclical, has strong predictive power for market returns and negatively predicts real economic activity. In order to identify the investors’ concerns associated with tail risk, I extract daily news from the largest financial newspaper in Brazil. The co-movement between news and tail risk indicates that tail risk variation is mainly driven by disaster concerns, followed by economic and government uncertainty. While economic uncertainty explains the countercyclical property of tail risk, investors only require compensation for bearing tail risk implied by disaster concerns. Similarly, tail risk negatively impacts real outcomes because of the disaster concerns that it identifies. These findings support recent models explaining asset pricing puzzles with time-varying disaster risk. © 2021},

	abstract = {Background: Patient and public involvement (PPI) in research has increased steadily over the last two decades and is now both expected and appropriately resourced by many funding bodies, including the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). However, PPI in research occurs in many different capacities and numerous frameworks exist for reporting or appraising patient involvement activities. The aim of this article is to describe processes involving PPI contributions to an NIHR-funded mixed-methods feasibility study (MoTaStim-Foot). Details of PPI advisors’ input, from initial identification and prioritisation of research ideas, to research delivery and dissemination, are discussed. Methods: Extensive PPI for MoTaStim-Foot is reported, with consideration of Research Design Service (RDS) advice for PPI for research, involving identifying and prioritising: design; grant proposal development; undertaking/managing research; analysing and interpreting; dissemination; implementation; monitoring and evaluation. Two PPI workshops were undertaken; success in meeting UK standards for public involvement was audited against specific success criteria by two researchers, with discussion and consideration regarding how well our PPI achieved inclusive opportunities, working together, support and learning, governance, communications and impact. How PPI can be improved for future trials was also considered. Although the advantages of PPI for researchers were considered, the benefits for PPI advisors were also analysed. Results: UK standards for public involvement were achieved, along with seven relevant research processes suggested by the RDS. PPI advisor contributions: informed study design; contributed to successful funding; enhanced trial delivery by informing participant information sheets and daily diaries; added value through undertaking note-taker roles in focus groups and helping to analyse focus group transcripts; and assisted in dissemination. However, benefits were mutual with PPI advisors reporting feeling valued and respected, a sense of pride with renewed confidence and purpose in life. Conclusions: Importance and value of PPI, to researchers and patient advisors, have been highlighted, reinforcing the benefits of working in partnership with PPI advisors.

	abstract = {Asset pricing in capital markets is a strikingly vibrant area of academic research and is considered as an indicator to evaluate the efficiency of stock markets. Though the explanation for the seasonal behavior of capital markets was attempted by various market models, several anomalies were observed historically. Calendar anomalies that belong to the specific class of seasonal anomalies provided abnormal returns in the global stock markets at regular intervals within and across various calendar years. This article documents the study on one such anomaly—namely, the turn-of-the-month effect in the context of Indian stock indices. In this pursuit, exhaustive research has been carried out considering all the broad-market and sectoral indices of two major stock exchanges, namely, National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange. The study used the ARIMAX methodology with dummy exogenous variables (to represent the turn-of-the-month days) and presented comprehensive findings and learnings. Besides, this article attempts to analyze the changes in the strength and significance of the anomaly in progression with various stock market reforms in both the broad-market and sectoral indices to provide new insights into the efficiency of Indian stock market exchanges. © 2021 K.

Conventional approaches formulate the problem as a single Markov decision process and apply reinforcement learning methods to provide solutions. However, it is well known that financial markets involve non-stationary processes, leading to violations of this assumption in these methods. In this work, we reformulate the portfolio optimization problem to deal with the non-stationary nature of financial markets. In our approach, we divide a long-term process into multiple short-term processes to adapt to context changes and consider the portfolio optimization problem as a multitask control problem. Thereafter, we propose an evolutionary meta reinforcement learning approach to search for an initial policy that can quickly adapt to the upcoming target tasks. We model the policies as convolutional networks that can score the match of the patterns in market data charts. Finally, we test our approach using real-world cryptographic currency data and show that it adapts well to the changes in the market and leads to better profitability.  © 2021 ACM.},

In general, these kinds of combining strategies rely heavily on the distribution assumption to decide the combining weights, which may weaken their practical applicability. To improve this, this paper utilizes multi-task relationship learning (MTRL) framework to estimate global minimum variance (GMV) weight and mean-variance (MV) tangency weight simultaneously, by estimating the correlation matrix between these two weights, achieving a combining-like result. In terms of empirical tests, this paper uses daily data of A-share market spanning from 2000 to 2019 to construct two datasets: factor portfolios and stock portfolios randomly collected from HS300 index constituents. The empirical out-of-sample result based on factor portfolio dataset suggests that MTRL-MV can achieve better performance than original MV, equally-weighted (EW) and other combining strategies in terms of Sharpe ratio, standard deviation and turnover. In the end, this paper uses three datasets: The subsample of factor portfolios from Chinese A share and US stock market and individual stock portfolios, to conduct robustness test, which confirms MTRL-MV's improvement compared to other strategies. © 2021, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

However, it is challenging to understand a DRL-based trading strategy because of the black-box nature of deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose an empirical approach to explain the strategies of DRL agents for the portfolio management task. First, we use a linear model in hindsight as the reference model, which finds the best portfolio weights by assuming knowing actual stock returns in foresight. In particular, we use the coefficients of a linear model in hindsight as the reference feature weights. Secondly, for DRL agents, we use integrated gradients to define the feature weights, which are the coefficients between reward and features under a linear regression model. Thirdly, we study the prediction power in two cases, single-step prediction and multi-step prediction. In particular, we quantify the prediction power by calculating the linear correlations between the feature weights of a DRL agent and the reference feature weights, and similarly for machine learning methods. Finally, we evaluate a portfolio management task on Dow Jones 30 constituent stocks during 01/01/2009 to 09/01/2021. Our approach empirically reveals that a DRL agent exhibits a stronger multi-step prediction power than machine learning methods.  © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {In this article, the authors present a conceptual framework named adaptive seriational risk parity (ASRP) to extend hierarchical risk parity (HRP) as an asset allocation heuristic. The first step of HRP (quasi-diagonalization), determining the hierarchy of assets, is required for the actual allocation done in the second step (recursive bisectioning). In the original HRP scheme, this hierarchy is found using single-linkage hierarchical clustering of the correlation matrix, which is a static tree-based method. The authors compare the performance of the standard HRP with other static and adaptive tree-based methods, as well as seriation-based methods that do not rely on trees. Seriation is a broader concept allowing reordering of the rows or columns of a matrix to best express similarities between the elements. Each discussed variation leads to a different time series reflecting portfolio performance using a 20-year backtest of a multi-asset futures universe. Unsupervised learning based on these time-series creates a taxonomy that groups the strategies in high correspondence to the construction hierarchy of the various types of ASRP. Performance analysis of the variations shows that most of the static tree-based alternatives to HRP outperform the single-linkage clustering used in HRP on a risk-adjusted basis. Adaptive tree methods show mixed results, and most generic seriation-based approaches underperform. © 2021, With intelligence. All rights reserved.},

Although critics argue that gamification derails the focus of learning and increases stress and competition, most scholars see that benefits outweigh the risks. They believe that gamification increases student engagement and reinforces their problem-solving skills, collaboration, and communication. In this paper, gamification is applied to skills required in the management of the company’s project business. In project business, the focus is not on individual projects, but on the organization’s project portfolio. The project portfolio refers to the company’s simultaneous projects and project opportunities that have common strategic goals and that are competing for the same resources. In the empirical part of the study, post-graduate students’ feedback on the project portfolio management (PPM) exercise was investigated using both manual and machine learning-based content and sentiment analysis. The results of the experiment indicate that student sentiment toward the PPM workshop was positive and that gamification seems to be a good method of learning project business skills, especially in the creation of the management and decision-making system and in managing a diverse project portfolio. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Successful portfolio management requires, in addition to advanced optimization strategies, effective recruitment of specialized financial advisors. Hiring the wrong ones can be detrimental to investors' financial goals. In this article, we propose an automated crowdsourcing system to organize cooperation between financial advisors and investors. Without interfering with their private portfolio optimization techniques, we design a recruitment framework that matches financial advisors to investors based on their profiles and features, as well as the previous activities of their peers. Using the database of the crowdsourcing platform, we employ an unsupervised technique to regroup advisors with a high degree of similarities into clusters and, hence, shrink the search space. Afterward, we train a machine learning regression model to predict the matching score that can be achieved if an investor hires a particular advisor. These scores are converted to weights of bipartite graphs to which we apply a double-phased many-to-many maximum weight matching algorithm to determine a suitable investor-advisor combination. In the simulations, we investigate the performance of the proposed recruitment approach and show that, compared with other traditional approaches, higher returns can be reached for both investors and financial advisors.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to the literature on the role of sentiment indices in heterogeneous asset pricing models. A new sentiment index in financial markets is proposed in which transactions take place between two groups of fundamentalists with divergent perceptions of fundamental value. It is assumed that the proportion of fundamentalists in the two groups depends on the sentiment index. After examining the analytical properties of the deterministic discrete dynamical system, stochastic components are added to the expectations of fundamentalists. First, the study measures the performance of the model in reproducing the stylized facts of financial data relying on the S&P 500 index. Second, the forecasting power of the model to predict the daily prices of the S&P 500 index is examined. For this purpose, the forecasting accuracy of the proposed dynamical model, where the sentiment index is explicitly modelled, is compared with a model where the sentiment index is not taken into account. In this case, the predictions are obtained by means of a machine learning technique (lasso regression). The results show that the sentiment index is important in explaining the stylized facts of financial returns and in forecasting prices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Portfolio management involves position sizing and resource allocation. Traditional and generic portfolio strategies require forecasting of future stock prices as model inputs, which is not a trivial task since those values are difficult to obtain in the real-world applications. To overcome the above limitations and provide a better solution for portfolio management, we developed a Portfolio Management System (PMS) using reinforcement learning with two neural networks (CNN and RNN). A novel reward function involving Sharpe ratios is also proposed to evaluate the performance of the developed systems. Experimental results indicate that the PMS with the Sharpe ratio reward function exhibits outstanding performance, increasing return by 39.0% and decreasing drawdown by 13.7% on average compared to the reward function of trading return. In addition, the proposed PMS_CNN model is more suitable for the construction of a reinforcement learning portfolio, but has 1.98 times more drawdown risk than the PMS_RNN. Among the conducted datasets, the PMS outperforms the benchmark strategies in TW50 and traditional stocks, but is inferior to a benchmark strategy in the financial dataset. The PMS is profitable, effective, and offers lower investment risk among almost all datasets. The novel reward function involving the Sharpe ratio enhances performance, and well supports resource-allocation for empirical stock trading. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Such a problem often arises in typical machine learning problems, but is computationally challenging. We apply an implementable randomized smoothing method and propose a multistage scheme to progressively reduce the variance of the gradient estimator of the smoothed functions. Our algorithm achieves a linear convergence rate. Both its time complexity and gradient complexity are superior to the current standard algorithms for non-smooth minimization as well as subgradient-based algorithms. Besides, our algorithm works well without the error-bound condition on the minimizing sequence as well as the commonly imposed (but strong) smoothness and strongly convexity condition. We show that our algorithm has wide applications in optimization and machine learning problems. As an illustrative example, we demonstrate experimentally that our algorithm performs well on large-scale ranking problems and risk-aware portfolio optimization problems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Ordinal regression has been widely used in applications, such as credit portfolio management, recommendation systems, and ecology, where the core task is to predict the labels on ordinal scales. Due to its learning efficiency, online ordinal regression using passive aggressive (PA) algorithms has gained a much attention for solving large-scale ranking problems. However, the PA method is sensitive to noise especially in the scenario of streaming data, where the ranking of data samples may change dramatically. In this paper, we propose a noise-resilient online learning algorithm using the Ramp loss function, called PA-RAMP, to improve the performance of PA method for noisy data streams. Also, we validate the order preservation of thresholds of the proposed algorithm. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed noise-resilient online ordinal regression algorithm is more robust and efficient than state-of-the-art online ordinal regression algorithms.  © 2022-IOS Press.

Since Fama and French (1993), hundreds of factors have been found to have explanatory power for asset pricing. To construct a factor model, two tasks have to be performed: Feature Selection, selecting a small subset given a large number of factors to overcome overfitting in regression, and Feature Engineering, determining the interactions between the factors. In this work, the process of constructing factor models (not the factors themselves) is examined. A unified, two-step process of dimensionality reduction and nonlinear transformation that produces parsimonious, general factor models is proposed. Comparisons between frameworks implementing linear feature selection models as well as non-linear feature reduction techniques are conducted. A second stage generalizes the models by learning nonlinear interactions. The framework attempts to strike a balance between accuracy and interpretability. Results of computational experiments on historical financial data, on three models of varying degrees of non-linearity and interpretability suggest that mixed-integer-programming-based formulations are suitable for the task of linear financial factor selection and that the second-stage nonlinearity due to neural networks improves accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Dynamic stochastic optimization models provide a powerful tool to represent sequential decision-making processes. Typically, these models use statistical predictive methods to capture the structure of the underlying stochastic process without taking into consideration estimation errors and model misspecification. In this context, we propose a data-driven prescriptive analytics framework aiming to integrate the machine learning and dynamic optimization machinery in a consistent and efficient way to build a bridge from data to decisions. The proposed framework tackles a relevant class of dynamic decision problems comprising many important practical applications. The basic building blocks of our proposed framework are: (1) a Hidden Markov Model as a predictive (machine learning) method to represent uncertainty; and (2) a distributionally robust dynamic optimization model as a prescriptive method that takes into account estimation errors associated with the predictive model and allows for control of the risk associated with decisions. Moreover, we present an evaluation framework to assess out-of-sample performance in rolling horizon schemes. A complete case study on dynamic asset allocation illustrates the proposed framework showing superior out-of-sample performance against selected benchmarks. The numerical results show the practical importance and applicability of the proposed framework since it extracts valuable information from data to obtain robustified decisions with an empirical certificate of out-of-sample performance evaluation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This paper shows that belief-driven economic fluctuations are a general feature of many determinate macroeconomic models. In environments with hidden state variables, forecast-model misspecification can break the link between indeterminacy and sunspots by establishing the existence of “statistical sunspots” in models that have a unique rational expectations equilibrium. To form expectations, agents regress on a set of observables that can include serially correlated nonfundamental factors (e.g., sunspots, judgment, expectations shocks, etc.). In equilibrium, agents attribute, in a self-fulfilling way, some of the serial correlation observed in data to extrinsic noise, i.e., statistical sunspots. This leads to sunspot equilibria in models with a unique rational expectations equilibrium. Unlike many rational sunspots, these equilibria are found to be generically stable under learning. Applications are developed in the context of a New Keynesian and an asset-pricing model. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The stock market is an aggregation of investor sentiment that affects daily changes in stock prices. Investor sentiment remained a mystery and challenge over time, inviting researchers to comprehend the market trends. The entry of behavioral scientists in and around the 1980s brought in the market trading’s human dimensions. Shortly after that, due to the digitization of exchanges, the mix of traders changed as institutional traders started using algorithmic trading (AT) on computers. Nevertheless, the effects of investor sentiment did not disappear and continued to intrigue market researchers. Though market sentiment plays a significant role in timing investment decisions, classical finance models largely ignored the role of investor sentiment in asset pricing. For knowing if the market price is value-driven, the investor would isolate components of irrationality from the price, as reflected in the sentiment. Investor sentiment is an expression of irrational expectations of a stock’s risk-return profile that is not justified by available information. In this context, the paper aims to predict the next-day trend in the index prices for the centralized Indian National Stock Exchange (NSE) deploying machine learning algorithms like support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep neural networks. The training set is historical NSE closing price data from June 1st, 2013-June 30th, 2020. Additionally, the authors factor technical indicators like moving average (MA), moving average convergence-divergence (MACD), K (%) oscillator and corresponding three days moving average D (%), relative strength indicator (RSI) value, and the LW (R%) indicator for the same period. The predictive power of deep neural networks over other machine learning techniques is established in the paper, demonstrating the future scope of deep learning in multi-parameter time series prediction. © 2021 IGI Global.

	abstract = {. This paper introduces a new algorithm for exploiting time-series predictability-based patterns to obtain an abnormal return, or alpha, with respect to a given benchmark asset pricing model. The algorithm proposes a deterministic daily market timing strategy that decides between being fully invested in a risky asset or in a risk-free asset, with the trading rule represented by a parametric perceptron. The optimal parameters are sought in-sample via differential evolution to directly maximize the alpha. Successively using two modern asset pricing models and two different portfolio weighting schemes, the algorithm was able to discover an undocumented anomaly in the United States stock market cross-section, both out-of-sample and using small transaction costs. The new algorithm represents a simple and flexible alternative to technical analysis and forecast-based trading rules, neither of which necessarily maximizes the alpha. This new algorithm was inspired by recent insights into representing reinforcement learning as evolutionary computation. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Vilnius Gediminas Technical University.},

The knowledge gathered from unsupervised learning is useful for improving portfolio optimization and making stock trading recommendations. Most methods available in the literature for clustering financial time series are based on exploiting linear relationships between time series. However, prices of different assets (stocks) may have non-linear relationships which may be quantified using information based measures such as mutual information (MI). To estimate the empirical mutual information between time series of stock returns, we employ a novel kernel density estimator (KDE) based jackknife mutual information estimation (JMI), and compare it with the widely-used binning method. We then propose an average distance gradient change algorithm and an algorithm based on the average silhouette criterion that use pairwise and groupwise MI of high-frequency financial stock returns. Through numerical studies, we provide insights into the impact of the clustering on asset allocation and risk management based on the nonlinear information structure of the US stock market. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

We develop a new framework to rigorously perform multiple hypothesis testing in linear asset pricing models, while limiting the occurrence of false positive results typically associated with data snooping. By exploiting a variety of machine learning techniques, our multiple-testing procedure is robust to omitted factors and missing data. We also prove its asymptotic validity when the number of tests is large relative to the sample size, as in many finance applications. To improve the finite sample performance, we also provide a wild-bootstrap procedure for inference and prove its validity in this setting.

In recent years, quantitative investment has become one of the research hotspots in the field of deep reinforcement learning. Combining portfolio management with deep reinforcement learning has become a hot research direction. The model in this paper combines the perception ability of deep learning and the online decision-making ability of reinforcement learning to construct an intelligent model of portfolio management based on deep reinforcement learning DDPG algorithm. This model addresses issues such as the limited ability of reinforcement learning models to perceive complex environments and the strong correlation between the internal features of state data, introducing the convolutional neural network into the DDPG model. The use of convolutional neural networks to process multi-dimensional state data improves the perception ability of the reinforcement learning model and solves the problem of data correlation. Therefore, the model in this paper can obtain the dynamic optimal investment portfolio within the specified trading time range. At the same time, this paper introduces the action vector into the state value representing the stock market environment, and solves the problem of static model. Experiments show that our model improves the income acquisition ability of the portfolio management model. © 2021 ACM.},

In this paper, we present ASPENDYS, a supportive platform for investors that combines various methods from the aforementioned scientific fields aiming to facilitate the management and the decision making of investment actions through personalized recommendations. To accomplish that, the system takes into account both financial data and textual data from news websites and the social networks Twitter and Stocktwits. The financial data are processed using methods of technical analysis and machine learning, while the textual data are analyzed regarding their reliability and then their sentiments towards an investment. As an outcome, investment signals are generated based on the financial data analysis and the sensing of the general sentiment towards a certain investment and are finally recommended to the investors. © 2021 by the authors.

Herding is more prevalent among listed SMEs (known as micro-caps in the US) during normal periods, while during crisis periods, all micro-cap investors are faced with the same informational problem and do not herd because they expect that none of them has information of better quality.

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increased interest from both academics and practitioners in automatically analyzing the textual part of companies’ financial reports to extract meaning rich in information for future outcomes. In particular, tracking textual changes among companies’ reports can have a large and significant impact on stock prices. This impact happens with a lag implying that investors only gradually realize the implications of the news hinted by document changes. However, the length of these documents as well as their complexity in terms of structure and language have been increasing dramatically making this process more and more difficult to perform. In this paper, we analyzed how to face this complexity by learning arbitrary dimensional vector representations for US corporate filings (10-Ks) from 1998 to 2018, exploiting and comparing different neural network embedding techniques which take into account words’ semantics through vectors proximity. We also compared their ability to capture changes associated with future risk-adjusted abnormal returns with other more commonly used approaches in literature. Finally, we propose a novel investment strategy named Semantic Similarity Portfolio (SSP) that exploits these neural network embeddings. We show that firms that do not change their 10-Ks in a semantically important way from the previous year tend to have large and statistically significant future risk-adjusted abnormal returns. We, also document an amplifying effect when we incorporate a momentum-related criterion, where the companies selected must also have had positive previous year returns. Specifically, a portfolio that buys “non-changers” based on this strategy earns up to 10% in yearly risk-adjusted abnormal returns (alpha). © 2020},

	abstract = {Portfolio optimisation is a multi-objective optimisation problem (MOP), where an investor aims to optimise the conflicting criteria of maximising a portfolio's expected return whilst minimising its risk and other costs. However, selecting a portfolio is a computationally expensive problem because of the cost associated with performing multiple evaluations on test data ("backtesting") rather than solving the convex optimisation problem itself. In this research, we present ParDen, an algorithm for the inclusion of any discriminative or generative machine learning model as a surrogate to mitigate the computationally expensive backtest procedure. In addition, we compare the performance of alternative metaheuristic algorithms: NSGA-II, R-NSGA-II, NSGA-III, R-NSGA-III, U-NSGA-III, MO-CMA-ES, and COMO-CMA-ES. We measure performance using multi-objective performance indicators, including Generational Distance Plus, Inverted Generational Distance Plus and Hypervol-ume. We also consider meta-indicators, Success Rate and Average Executions to Success Rate, of the Hypervolume to provide more insight into the quality of solutions. Our results show that ParDen can reduce the number of evaluations required by almost a third while obtaining an improved Pareto front over the state-of-the-art for the problem of portfolio selection. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an optimal hedging strategy in the presence of market frictions using the Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) method, which is a modification of the method proposed in Buehler et al. (Deep hedging. Quant. Finance, 2019, 19(8), 1271–1291). The market frictions are transaction costs, liquidity constraints, trading limits and cost of funds. The loss function is a spectral risk measure. We first make an empirical analysis of the LSTM-RNN model of real option markets, which are the Asian market (domestic market 50 ETF option, Hong Kong Hang Seng Index Option, Nikkei Index Option), the North American market (S&P 500 Index Option) and the European market (FTSE 100 Index Option). The benchmark models are from Leland (Option pricing and replication with transaction costs. J. Finance., 1985, 40(5), 1283–1301), Boyle and Vorst (Option replication in discrete time with transaction costs. J. Finance, 1992, 47(1), 271–293) and Whalley and Wilmott (A hedging strategy and option valuation model with transaction costs. OCIAM Working Paper, Mathematical Institute, Oxford, 1993). Finally, we compare the results from the LSTM-RNN model with benchmark models involving transaction costs for both simulated market data generated by Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and the Heston model and real market data. The results show that the LSTM-RNN model outperforms benchmark models for low or medium volatility (<0.8), OTM moneyness and under a certain risk level (<80%) in the GBM market setting. For the 50ETF option market, the LSTM-RNN model outperforms benchmark models for ATM and under a certain risk level (<15%). For the HSI option market, the LSTM-RNN model outperforms benchmark models when transaction costs are smaller than 1.5%. For the Nikkei and S&P 500 option markets, the LSTM-RNN model always outperforms benchmark models. For the FTSE option market, the LSTM-RNN model outperforms benchmark models when moneyness is not too deeply ITM. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The concept of modeling the portfolio management through a reinforcement learning formulation is novel, and the Deep Q-Network has been successfully applied to portfolio management recently. However, the model does not take into account of commission fee for transaction. This paper introduces a framework, based on the hierarchical Deep Q-Network, that addresses the issue of zero commission fee by reducing the number of assets assigned to each Deep Q-Network and dividing the total portfolio value into smaller parts. Furthermore, this framework is flexible enough to handle an arbitrary number of assets. In our experiments, the time series of four stocks for three different time periods are used to assess the efficacy of our model. It is found that our hierarchical Deep Q-Network based strategy outperforms ten other strategies, including nine traditional strategies and one reinforcement learning strategy, in profitability as measured by the Cumulative Rate of Return. Moreover, the Sharpe ratio and Max Drawdown metrics both demonstrate that the risk of policy associated with hierarchical Deep Q-Network is the lowest among all ten strategies. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

Categorising projects allows the organisation to identify categories with a lack or excess of projects, according to its strategic objectives. In this work, we present a new method for project portfolio management based on hierarchical clustering (PPM-HC) to organise the projects at several levels of abstraction. In the PPM-HC, similar projects are allocated to the same clusters and subclusters. PPM-HC automatically learns an understandable topic hierarchy from the project portfolio dataset, thereby facilitating the (human) task of exploring, analysing and prioritising the projects of the organisation. We also proposed a card sorting-based technique which allows the evaluation of the projects categorisation using an intuitive visual map. We carried out an experimental evaluation based on a benchmark dataset and we also presented a real-world case study. The results show that the proposed PPM-HC method is promising. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The main objective of the proposed method is to provide a less arbitrary learning procedure to quantify similarity levels between investment alternatives (pairwise) as well as revealing clustering patterns (whole sample). This is especially useful during periods of high volatility, when investment alternatives tend to become more similar and, therefore, harder to distinguish between themselves. The method dynamics may be readily interpreted through a clear data visualisation. The advantages and caveats of the proposed method is compared to the most popular class of cluster analysis, applied to the well-known Fisher's Iris dataset. Such results show a slightly superior performance of the proposed method but, most importantly, through remarkably different clustering allocation approaches. Moreover, further empirical results applied to daily data reflecting a period of 15 years of time series of economies/stock markets of the Group of Seven (G7) illustrate the potential practical usefulness of the proposed unsupervised learning method, particularly, for portfolio strategy, asset allocation, and investment diversification. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Although socially responsible investment (SRI) has developed into an important investment style, only a small number of studies discuss SRI portfolio construction. In view of the overwhelming breakthrough of machine learning in prediction, this paper proposes SRI portfolio construction models by combining a double-screening mechanism considering machine learning prediction and an extended global minimum variance (GMV) model (or extended maximum Sharpe ratio (MSPR) model), which are, respectively, named double-screening socially responsible investment (DSSRI) portfolio models I and II. The proposed models consist of two stages, i.e., stock screening and asset allocation. First, this paper develops a novel double-screening mechanism incorporating environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) and return potential criteria to ensure that high-quality stocks with good ESG performance and high-return potential are input into the optimal portfolio. Specifically, to obtain accurate stock return predictions, an extreme learning machine model optimized by the genetic algorithm is employed to predict stock prices. Next, to trade off the financial and ESG objectives of SRI investors, an extended GMV model (or extended MSPR model) considering the ESG factor is introduced to determine the capital allocation proportion of the stocks. We take the A-share market of China as the sample to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models. The empirical results demonstrate that compared with alternative models, the proposed models can yield better annualized return and ESG score performance as well as competitive Sharpe ratio performance.  © 2021 Jun Zhang and Xuedong Chen.},

	abstract = {Exchange rate movements can significantly impact not only foreign trade, capital flows, and asset portfolio management, but also real economic activity. Therefore, the forecast of exchange rates has always been of great interest among academics, economic agents, and institutions. However, exchange rate series are essentially dynamic and nonlinear in nature and thus, forecasting exchange rates is a difficult task. On the other hand, deep learning models in solving time series forecasting tasks have been proposed in the last half-decade. But the number of formal comparative study in terms of exchange rate forecasting with deep learning models is quite limited. For this purpose, this study applies ten different models (Random Walk, Autoregressive Moving Average, Threshold Autoregression, Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average, Support Vector Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit and Autoregressive Moving Average-Long Short Term Memory Hybrid Models) and two forecasting modes (recursive and rolling window) to predict three major exchange rate returnsnamely, the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and British pound against the US Dollar in monthly terms. To evaluate the forecasting performances of the models, we used Model Confidence Set procedure as an advanced test. According to our results, the proposed hybrid model produced the best out-of-sample forecast performance in all samples, without exception. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Integrating return prediction of traditional time series models in portfolio formation can improve the performance of original portfolio optimization model. Since machine learning and deep learning models have shown overwhelming superiority than time series models, this paper combines return prediction in portfolio formation with two machine learning models, i.e., random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR), and three deep learning models, i.e., LSTM neural network, deep multilayer perceptron (DMLP) and convolutional neural network. To be specific, this paper first applies these prediction models for stock preselection before portfolio formation. Then, this paper incorporates their predictive results in advancing mean–variance (MV) and omega portfolio optimization models. In order to present the superiority of these models, portfolio models with autoregressive integrated moving average's return prediction are used as benchmarks. Evaluation is based on historical data of 9 years from 2007 to 2015 of component stocks of China securities 100 index. Experimental results show that MV and omega models with RF return prediction, i.e., RF+MVF and RF+OF, outperform the other models. Further, RF+MVF is superior to RF+OF. Due to the high turnover of these two models, this paper discusses their performance after deducting the transaction fee cased by turnover. Experiments present that RF+MVF still performs the best among MVF models and omega model with SVR prediction (SVR+OF) performs the best among OF models. Moreover, RF+MVF performs better than SVR+OF and high turnover erodes nearly half of their total returns especially for RF+OF and RF+MVF. Therefore, this paper recommends investors to build MVF with RF return prediction for daily trading investment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Many researchers have incorporated deep neural networks (DNNs) with reinforcement learning (RL) in automatic trading systems. However, such methods result in complicated algorithmic trading models with several defects, especially when a DNN model is vulnerable to malicious adversarial samples. Researches have rarely focused on planning for long-term attacks against RL-based trading systems. To neutralize these attacks, researchers must consider generating imperceptible perturbations while simultaneously reducing the number of modified steps. In this research, an adversary is used to attack an RL-based trading agent. First, we propose an extension of the ensemble of the identical independent evaluators (EIIE) method, called enhanced EIIE, in which information on the best bids and asks is incorporated. Enhanced EIIE was demonstrated to produce an authoritative trading agent that yields better portfolio performance relative to that of an EIIE agent. Enhanced EIIE was then applied to the adversarial agent for the agent to learn when and how much to attack (in the form of introducing perturbations).In our experiments, our proposed adversarial attack mechanisms were > 30% more effective at reducing accumulated portfolio value relative to the conventional attack mechanisms of the fast gradient sign method (FSGM) and iterative FSGM, which are currently more commonly researched and adapted to compare and improve.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We explore the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms, especially deep reinforcement learning, for solving the portfolio optimization problem. The investigated algorithms can be divided into the following groups: “Follow-the-Winner” (using trend follow principle), “Follow-the-Loser” (using mean reversion principle) “Pattern-Matching” (for example, using correlations between current prices and historical prices), “Meta-Learning Algorithms” (combination of several algorithms) and, finally, strategies based on reinforcement learning. We propose a novel meta-learning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which we call MetaRL. It utilizes algorithms from different groups and optimizes their combination. Reinforcement learning (RL) technique is well suited to solve portfolio selection tasks because it can learn hidden dependencies in financial data and trading patterns by trial and error, directly predicts trading actions, and allows to consider delayed rewards. Moreover, RL naturally takes into account transaction costs and can model real trading when the strategy can impact the market. As agents, we use deep neural networks that decide which of the algorithms will be more profitable at a particular moment. We provide extensive experiments using financial data and show that our new MetaRL algorithm substantially outperforms other portfolio optimization methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A composite sentiment index (CSI) from quantitative proxy sentiment indicators is likely to be a lag sentiment measure as it reflects only the information absorbed in the market. Information theories and behavioral finance research suggest that market prices may not adjust to all the available information at a point in time. This study hypothesizes that the sentiment from the unincorporated information may provide possible market leads. Thus, this paper aims to discuss a method to identify the un-incorporated qualitative Sentiment from information unadjusted in the market price to test whether sentiment polarity from the information can impact stock returns. Factoring market sentiment extracted from unincorporated information (residual sentiment or sentiment backlog) in CSI is an essential step for developing an integrated sentiment index to explain deviation in asset prices from their intrinsic value. Identifying the unincorporated Sentiment also helps in text analytics to distinguish between current and future market sentiment. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, this study collects the news from various textual sources and runs the NVivo tool to compute the corpus data’s sentiment polarity. Subsequently, using the predictability horizon technique, this paper mines the unincorporated component of the news’s sentiment polarity. This study regresses three months’ sentiment polarity (the current period and its lags for two months) on the NIFTY50 index of the National Stock Exchange of India. If the three-month lags are significant, it indicates that news sentiment from the three months is unabsorbed and is likely to impact the future NIFTY50 index. The sentiment is also conditionally tested for firm size, volatility and specific industry sector-dependence. This paper discusses the implications of the results. Findings: Based on information theories and empirical findings, the paper demonstrates that it is possible to identify unincorporated information and extract the sentiment polarity to predict future market direction. The sentiment polarity variables are significant for the current period and two-month lags. The magnitude of the sentiment polarity coefficient has decreased from the current period to lag one and lag two. This study finds that the unabsorbed component or backlog of news consisted of mainly negative market news or unconfirmed news of the previous period, as illustrated in Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 2. The findings on unadjusted news effects vary with firm size, volatility and sectoral indices as depicted in Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6. Originality/value: The related literature on sentiment index describes top-down/ bottom-up models using quantitative proxy sentiment indicators and natural language processing (NLP)/machine learning approaches to compute the sentiment from qualitative information to explain variance in market returns. NLP approaches use current period sentiment to understand market trends ignoring the unadjusted sentiment carried from the previous period. The underlying assumption here is that the market adjusts to all available information instantly, which is proved false in various empirical studies backed by information theories. The paper discusses a novel approach to identify and extract sentiment from unincorporated information, which is a critical sentiment measure for developing a holistic sentiment index, both in text analytics and in top-down quantitative models. Practitioners may use the methodology in the algorithmic trading models and conduct stock market research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this study, two portfolio optimization algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm performs the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for stock return forecasting and the meanvariance (MV) model for portfolio selection. The second algorithm modifies the MV model by introducing an additional penalty term based on the prediction error of XGBoost.

Adaptive robust problems offer many advantages but require handling a double optimization problem (infimum over market measures, supremum over the control) at each instance. Moreover, the underlying Bellman equations are intrinsically multidimensional. We propose a novel machine learning approach that solves for the local saddle-point at a chosen set of inputs and then uses a nonparametric (Gaussian process) regression to obtain a functional representation of the value function. Our algorithm resembles control randomization and regression Monte Carlo techniques but also brings multiple innovations, including adaptive experimental design, separate surrogates for optimal control and the local worst-case measure, and computational speed-ups for the sup-inf optimization. Thanks to the new scheme we are able to consider settings that have been previously computationally intractable and provide several new financial insights about learning and optimal trading under unknown market parameters. In particular, we demonstrate the financial advantages of adaptive robust framework compared to adaptive and static robust alternatives. © 2021 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics},

The former type of households constructs their beliefs about expected capital gains by Bayesian learning from observed growth rates of stock prices. In a homogenous agent model with only subjective beliefs, the effect of the interest rate on stock prices tends to be unrealistically strong. I show how the presence of heterogeneity improves second moments of stock prices with realistic moments of business cycle properties. This quantitative improvement in stock price behaviors allows me to conduct a realistic analysis of how the stance of monetary policy affects stock price volatilities. Strong inertia of monetary policy provides the stability of stock prices. This is because the near-term real interest rate has dominant effects on stock prices under the presence of subjective beliefs since the presence limits the forward-looking nature in pricing stocks. However, because output depends on the expected path of the real interest rate in the forward-looking manner, strong monetary policy inertia does not necessarily provide stabilities of stock prices and output at the same time. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {E-commerce furnishes farmers in rural China with a novel solution accomplishing entrepreneurship transformation, but serious credit constraints still coexist with it at present, which may restrict the release of e-commerce’s potential. Therefore, this study investigates whether formal credit promotes entrepreneurial farmers’ e-commerce utilization and explores its influencing mechanism. Based on the survey data collected from 831 entrepreneurial farmers in Shaanxi province, Ningxia province and Shandong province in rural China, the propensity score matching (PSM) method was applied to measure the impact of formal credit on e-commerce utilization. The results show that formal credit contributes to a 18.41% increase of e-commerce utilization in general and increases entrepreneurial farmers’ online purchases and sales by 11.15% and 14.69%, respectively. Some groups perform significantly in the heterogeneity analysis, the most noteworthy of which are entrepreneurial farmers who are younger, belong to new type of agricultural business entities and use mobile payments. Their e-commerce utilization, including online purchases and sales, are impacted most by formal credit. Furthermore, when the bootstrap method was used to examine the mediating effect, we found that formal credit has a positive and significant effect on the utilization of e-commerce through four channels, which are internet learning, asset allocation, labor allocation and income growth. Hence, the findings suggest that the government should augment the amount of formal credit to optimize entrepreneurial farmers’ internet learning, asset allocation, labor employment and income growth, thereby promoting e-commerce to achieve entrepreneurial transformation and sustainable development in rural areas. © 2021 by the authors.

A credibilistic multiobjective mean-VaR model is formulated for the multiperiod portfolio selection problem, whereby the return is quantified by the credibilistic mean and the risk is measured by the credibilistic VaR. We also consider liquidity, cardinality, and upper and lower bound constraints to obtain a more realistic model. Furthermore, to solve the proposed model efficiently, an improved multiobjective bat algorithm termed IMBA is designed, in which three new strategies, i.e., the global best solution selection strategy, candidate solution generation strategy, and competitive learning strategy, are proposed to increase the convergence speed and improve the solution quality. Finally, comparative experiments are presented to show the applicability and superiority of the proposed approaches from two aspects. First, the designed IMBA is compared with seven typical algorithms, i.e., multiobjective particle swarm optimization, multiobjective artificial bee colony, multiobjective firefly algorithm, multiobjective differential evolution, multiobjective bat, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2), on a number of benchmark test problems.

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) in the context of portfolio optimisation (PO) aims to generate profits beyond the abilities of human traders. However, there is no definitive framework sufficiently able to generate consistent profits in line with expectations on real-world stock exchanges. Previous research has demonstrated the ability of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) and Fuzzy Deep Recurrent Neural Network (FDRNN) methodologies to generate positive results within controlled testing environments. This paper consolidates recent progress by evaluating these RL methodologies applied to five different stock exchanges. The selected methodologies are tested on real-world data within a simulated trading framework to assess their performance under different market conditions. To this end, we extend the FDRNN method to allow it to interact with a multi-asset market. As a result, in contrast to previous methods, our new Multi-Asset FDRNN (MA-FDRNN) can take short positions, which we hypothesised would give it an advantage over DDPG, PPO and EIIE. To assess the performance of the RL methods, we compare their results to a selection of benchmark PO algorithms. The results show the superiority of the MA-FDRNN method within the sideways and bear market, where it can exploit short positions and earn higher returns at lower risk than the other methods. In the bull markets, the benchmark algorithms outperform the RL agents, and in the crashed market, the RL methods and benchmark algorithms demonstrate similar performance. The results indicate that while RL methods do show some promise in achieving the goals of portfolio management, further research is needed to create an RL framework capable of succeeding in real-world market conditions. © 2021 IEEE.},

This motivates a new approach to multi-task learning, which involves the design of an appropriate neural network architecture and a prioritized task-sampling strategy. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two real-world sequential resource allocation tasks where this invariance property occurs: financial portfolio optimization and meta federated learning.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This geologic note provides a lookback on lookbacks, hopefully to spur further interest by companies in generating learning from exploration experience, rather than being victimized by repeated mistakes to which exploration assessment may unknowingly be exposed. The lookback contribution to portfolio management is properly called performance tracking. Likely inspired by the afteraction review process installed by the US Army approximately 50 yr ago, oil industry published results of tracking predictive performance began via a simple cross plot (predrill prospect resource size versus postdrill accumulation resource size) by US Geological Survey (USGS) workers documenting discovery sizes on the United States continental shelf. Whereas predrill estimates made by the USGS were relatively accurate, analogous publications by the industry have usually documented recurring optimistic bias. Other contributions have demonstrated the utility of determining (1) the efficiency of prospect ranking by various predrill estimation parameters (via an estimation efficiency plot), (2) when a drilling program falls outside of statistical control (via a sequential aggregation plot), and (3) where along a series of predrill forecast distributions persistent estimation bias has occurred (via a percentile histogram). These basics can serve as a starting point for any company to build their own baseline study to learn what aspects of their many estimates need improvement.  © 2021.

With advances in artificial intelligence, many studies have indicated that deep reinforcement learning (RL) can perform well in quantitative trading by predicting price change trends in the financial market. However, most of the related frameworks display poor generalizability in the testing stage. Thus, we incorporated adversarial learning and a novel sampling strategy for RL portfolio management. The goal was to construct a portfolio comprising five assets from the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and to achieve excellent performance through our trading strategy. We used adversarial learning during the RL process to enhance the model's robustness. Moreover, to improve the model's computational efficiency, we introduced a novel sampling strategy to determine which data are worth learning by observing the learning condition. The experimental results revealed that the model with our sampling strategy had more favorable performance than the random learning strategy. The Sharpe ratio increased by 6 %-7 %, and profit increased by nearly 45 %. Thus, our proposed learning framework and the sampling strategy we employed are conducive to obtaining reliable trading rules.  © 2013 IEEE.},

In this work, we propose the first full-cycle data-driven investment robo-advising framework, consisting of two ML agents. The first agent, an inverse portfolio optimization agent, infers an investor's risk preference and expected return directly from historical allocation data using online inverse optimization. The second agent, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent, aggregates the inferred sequence of expected returns to formulate a new multi-period mean-variance portfolio optimization problem that can be solved using deep RL approaches. The proposed investment pipeline is applied on real market data from April 1, 2016 to February 1, 2021 and has shown to consistently outperform the SP 500 benchmark portfolio that represents the aggregate market optimal allocation. The outperformance may be attributed to the the multi-period planning (versus single-period planning) and the data-driven RL approach (versus classical estimation approach). © 2021 IEEE.},

For example, it has been widely used in the financial area which is vital to the society, such as high-frequency trading, portfolio optimization, fraud detection and risk management. Stock market prediction is one of the most popular and valuable areas in finance. In this paper, it proposes a stock prediction model using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) used as a generator that inputs historical stock price and generates future stock price and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a discriminator to discriminate between the real stock price and generated stock price. Different from the traditional methods, which limited the forecasting on one-step-ahead only, by contrast, using the deep learning algorithm is possible to conduct the multi-step ahead prediction more accurately. In this study, it chose the Apple Inc. stock closing price as the target price, with features such as S&P 500 index, NASDAQ Composite index, U.S. Dollar index, etc. In addition, FinBert has been utilized to generate a news sentiment index for Apple Inc. as an additional predicting feature. Finally, this paper compares the proposed GAN model results with the baseline model. © 2021 HungChun Lin, Chen Chen, GaoFeng Huang and Amir Jafari.

	abstract = {In the light of current boom in the stock market and deviation from the fundamentals, every investor is worried about formation of a bubble and about the dire consequences that will follow when the bubble bursts. One solution is to avoid capital markets and park money in safe instruments like bank fixed deposits. However, given the low interest rate environment we are in, this option would not be financially savvy. Secondly, one can opt for portfolio management services but that would incur heavy management fees depending on the type of fund one chooses. Efficient management of wealth is very crucial in order to fulfil one's financial goals. All strategies of trading require a significant amount of time and research to determine a trade that would be worth the risk. Sometimes, even after spending hours on research, one might not be able to find an opportunity with an optimum risk-reward ratio. However, it might not be possible for working professionals to devote so much time every day to identify the right trades. With a view to solving this problem, we have built a model using reinforcement learning which will provide users with buy-sell signals based on the theme of pairs trading. Pairs Trading is a relatively safer strategy that tries to create a market neutral position, thereby providing a hedge to some extent against violent market movements. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Inverse multiobjective optimization provides a general framework for the unsupervised learning task of inferring parameters of a multiobjective decision making problem (DMP), based on a set of observed decisions from the human expert. However, the performance of this framework relies critically on the availability of an accurate DMP, sufficient decisions of high quality, and a parameter space that contains enough information about the DMP. To hedge against the uncertainties in the hypothetical DMP, the data, and the parameter space, we investigate in this paper the distributionally robust approach for inverse multiobjective optimization. Specifically, we leverage the Wasserstein metric to construct a ball centered at the empirical distribution of these decisions. We then formulate a Wasserstein distributionally robust inverse multiobjective optimization problem (WRO-IMOP) that minimizes a worst-case expected loss function, where the worst case is taken over all distributions in the Wasserstein ball. We show that the excess risk of the WRO-IMOP estimator has a sub-linear convergence rate. Furthermore, we propose the semi-infinite reformulations of the WRO-IMOP and develop a cutting-plane algorithm that converges to an approximate solution in finite iterations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both a synthetic multiobjective quadratic program and a real world portfolio optimization problem.

However, since the financial market has a highly non-stationary nature hindering the application of typical data-hungry machine learning methods, leveraging financial inductive biases is important to ensure better sample efficiency and robustness. In this study, we propose a novel method of constructing a portfolio based on predicting the distribution of a financial quantity called residual factors, which is known to be generally useful for hedging the risk exposure to common market factors. The key technical ingredients are twofold. First, we introduce a computationally efficient extraction method for the residual information, which can be easily combined with various prediction algorithms. Second, we propose a novel neural network architecture that allows us to incorporate widely acknowledged financial inductive biases such as amplitude invariance and time-scale invariance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on U.S. and Japanese stock market data. Through ablation experiments, we also verify that each individual technique contributes to improving the performance of trading strategies. We anticipate our techniques may have wide applications in various financial problems. Copyright © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

	abstract = {The success of portfolio construction depends primarily on the future performance of stock markets. Recent developments in machine learning have brought significant opportunities to incorporate prediction theory into portfolio selection. However, many studies show that a single prediction model is insufficient to achieve very accurate predictions and affluent returns. In this paper, a novel portfolio construction approach is developed using a hybrid model based on machine learning for stock prediction and mean–variance (MV) model for portfolio selection. Specifically, two stages are involved in this model: stock prediction and portfolio selection. In the first stage, a hybrid model combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with an improved firefly algorithm (IFA) is proposed to predict stock prices for the next period. The IFA is developed to optimize the hyperparameters of the XGBoost. In the second stage, stocks with higher potential returns are selected, and the MV model is employed for portfolio selection. Using the Shanghai Stock Exchange as the study sample, the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to traditional ways (without stock prediction) and benchmarks in terms of returns and risks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Thus, the proposed model aims to forecast a stock market index, with the aid of other economic indicators, employing a historic dataset of at least eleven years for all the variables. To accomplish this, a target function is proposed: a multiple non-linear regressive model. The relevance of computational finance is discussed, pointing out that is an area that has developed significantly in the last decades with different applications, some of these are: rich portfolio optimization, index-tracking, credit risk, stock investment, among others. Specifically, the Index Tracking Problem (ITP) concerns the prediction of stock market prices, being this a complex problem of the kind NP-hard. In this work, is discussed the undertaken innovative approach to implement the AON method, its main properties, as well as its implementation using the topology defined as Artificial Hydrocarbon Network (AHN), to tackle the ITP.

The optimal weight of each asset in the portfolio is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation as well as solving the quadratic equation of the given optimization problem.

	abstract = {In recent years, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has been gaining popularity amongst borrowers and individual investors. This can mainly be attributed to the easy and quick access to loans and the higher possible returns. However, the risk involved in these investments is considerable, and for most investors, being nonprofessionals, this increases the complexity and the importance of investment decisions. In this study, we focus on generating optimal investment decisions to lenders for selecting loans. We treat the loan selection process in P2P lending as a portfolio optimization problem, with the aim being to select a set of loans that provide a required return while minimizing risk. In the process, we use internal rate of return as the measure of return. As the starting point of the model, we use machine-learning algorithms to predict the default probabilities and calculate expected values for the loans based on historical data. Afterwards, we calculate the distance between loans using (i) default probabilities and, as a novel step, (ii) expected value. In the calculations, we utilize kernel functions to obtain similarity weights of loans as the input of the optimization models. Two optimization models are tested and compared on data from the popular P2P platform Lending Club. The results show that using the expected-value framework yields higher return. © 2021 The Authors.

The investment strategy framework uses Convolutional Neural Network and Visual Geometry Group Network.

This problem is especially important in cryptocurrency markets, which already support the trading of hundreds of assets with new ones being added every month. A novel neural network architecture is proposed, which is trained using deep reinforcement learning. Our architecture considers all assets in the market, and automatically adapts when new ones are suddenly introduced, making our method more general and sample-efficient than previous methods. Further, transaction cost minimization is considered when formulating the problem. For this purpose, a novel algorithm to compute optimal transactions given a desired portfolio is integrated into the architecture.

	abstract = {Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is an extremely popular risk measure in finance and is usually optimized to reduce the risk of large losses. This paper considers the CVaR optimization problem for hedging a portfolio of derivatives with bounded constraints. We focus on minimizing the CVaR of the loss of the hedging portfolio by a deep learning solution because of its promising application to classic portfolio optimization. As the cost objective function in the deep learning framework, the CVaR does not have a closed-form expression, but it can be estimated by using the i.i.d samples average approximation method. While many works have adopted minimizing the estimated CVaR to obtain the optimal solution, they lack theoretical performance guarantees for sample-based solutions. This paper attempts to bridge this gap. On the one hand, we introduce a typical deep neural network architecture for training the optimal hedging strategies, which helps us to analyze the properties of function set for this neural network. On the other hand, we offer a sufficient condition to guarantee that the optimal strategies obtained by using the estimated CVaR can be assured in practical applications. In particular, we prove that the uniform convergence in probability of the estimated CVaR to CVaR over a set of functions, which are generated by the proposed deep neural network. Numerical experiments verify the proposed sufficient condition and demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of this approach. © 2020},

	abstract = {Nowadays, cryptocurrencies are established and widely recognized as an alternative exchange currency method. They have infiltrated most financial transactions and as a result cryptocurrency trade is generally considered one of the most popular and promising types of profitable investments. Nevertheless, this constantly increasing financial market is characterized by significant volatility and strong price fluctuations over a short-time period therefore, the development of an accurate and reliable forecasting model is considered essential for portfolio management and optimization. In this research, we propose a multiple-input deep neural network model for the prediction of cryptocurrency price and movement. The proposed forecasting model utilizes as inputs different cryptocurrency data and handles them independently in order to exploit useful information from each cryptocurrency separately. An extensive empirical study was performed using three consecutive years of cryptocurrency data from three cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization i.e., Bitcoin (BTC), Etherium (ETH), and Ripple (XRP). The detailed experimental analysis revealed that the proposed model has the ability to efficiently exploit mixed cryptocurrency data, reduces overfitting and decreases the computational cost in comparison with traditional fully-connected deep neural networks. © 2021 by the authors.

To address these issues, a portfolio management model is proposed that makes use of Deep Learning Models for weekly financial time series forecasting of returns. Our model uses a late fusion of an ensemble of forecast models and modifies the standard mean-variance optimiser to account for transaction costs, making it suitable for multi-period trading. Our empirical results show that our portfolio management tool outperforms the equally-weighted portfolio benchmark and the buy-and-hold strategy, using both Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit forecasts. Although the portfolios are profitable, they are also sub-optimal in terms of their risk to reward ratio. Therefore, greater forecasting accuracy is necessary to construct truly optimal portfolios.  © 2021 International Society of Information Fusion (ISIF).},

To realize this, we first derive a confidence bound of VAR and then prove the existence of values of the environmental random variable (to be selected to achieve no regret) such that the confidence bound of VAR lies within that of the objective function evaluated at such values. Our V-UCB algorithm empirically demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in optimizing synthetic benchmark functions, a portfolio optimization problem, and a simulated robot task.

We introduce here a conditional normalizing flow based estimate of the time-to-event density as a way to model highly flexible and individualized conditional survival distributions. We use a novel hierarchical formulation of normalizing flows to enable efficient fitting of flexible conditional distributions without overfitting and show how the normalizing flow formulation can be efficiently adapted to the censored setting.

We provide evidence of marginal classification improvement after using ML tools, which employ analysts’ earnings estimate revisions and natural language processing to extract the tone and events of interest from news stories written about a firm. However, this improvement is statistically very significant. An application of this study is in portfolio rebalancing and short-term trading decisions, especially in quantitative portfolio management. With broad portfolios, during a normal rebalancing, one can delay the sale of a few stocks with prices predicted to increase significantly in the short term and substitute stocks with similar characteristics and alpha expectations. Likewise, one can delay the purchase of stocks that the quantitative model wishes to buy, but the ML model predicts to decrease significantly in the short term. © 2021 Portfolio Management Research.

	abstract = {Predictive analytics has a wide range of applications in many industries operating on a routine basis. The oil industry is in a state of constant evolution, with events in 2020 being the highlight of volatility and unpredictability. The main objectives of this paper showcase that improved predictive analytics method can serve as the foundation within the decision-making process, that leads to the goal of accuracy planning and cost-effectiveness in the oil and gas industry. The initial step of the improved methodology is utilizing data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques to build a financial model capturing essential trends. The budget is forecasted based on the basket of weighted factors, including historical data, request of capital expenditure, operating cost, and other factors. The core is at the reviews of portfolio optimization. It focuses on rebalancing cash priorities to reduce capital and operating expenditures driven by new technology, cost savings, and project schedule revision. The vital step is the separation of operating costs from capital investment. A periodical review is imperative to capture the ad-hoc significant events. Utilizing the above improved predictive analytical methods helps to increase the accuracy of planning and budgeting. It is also time-efficient for the decision-maker to identify the focused area or benchmark with peers based on the trend derived from predictive analysis. Meanwhile, the scorecard and subject matter experts review ensures that the selected tasks are strategically aligned with the organization's short-term target and long-term goals. Portfolio optimization reviews contribute to substantial savings in both capital and operational spending. Periodical reviews can timely identify the deviation, include those variances in the module, and provide a practical year-end forecast. Changes do not happen over the night. It is time-efficient and cost-effective to apply improved predictive analytics during the decision-making process to make financial planning and budget based on the trend and a series of well-defined factors. Those factors should be qualified as well as quantified after internal reviews. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

	abstract = {Time-series forecasting is a fundamental problem associated with a wide range of engineering, financial, and social applications. The challenge arises from the complexity due to the time-variant property of time series and the inevitable diminishing utility of predictive models. Therefore, it is generally difficult to accurately predict values, especially in a multi-step ahead setting. However, in domains such as financial time series forecasting, an ex-ante prediction of the relative order of values in the near future is sufficient; i.e., the next 100 days can help make meaningful investment decisions. In this paper, we propose a dynamic prediction framework that makes it possible to make an ex-ante forecast of time series with a special focus on the relative ordering of the forecast within a forward-looking time horizon. Through the lens of the concordance index (CI), we compare the proposed method with conventional regression-based time-series forecasting methods, discriminative learning methods and hybrid methods. Moreover, we discuss the use of the proposed framework for different types of time series and under a variety of conditions. Extensive experimental results on financial time series across a majority of liquid asset classes show that the proposed framework outperforms the benchmark methods significantly. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

	abstract = {With the increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to portfolio management. However, shortcomings remain. Specifically, because the training environment of an RL-based portfolio optimization framework is usually constructed based on historical price data in the literature, the agent potentially 1) violates the definition of a Markov decision process (MDP), 2) ignores their own market impact, or 3) fails to account for causal relationships within interaction processes; these ultimately lead the agent to make poor generalizations. To surmount these problems - specifically, to help the RL-based portfolio agent make better generalizations - we introduce an interactive training environment that leverages a generative model, called the limit order book-generative adversarial model (LOB-GAN), to simulate a financial market. Specifically, the LOB-GAN models market ordering behavior, and LOB-GAN's generator is utilized as a market behavior simulator. A simulated financial market, called Virtual Market, is constructed by the market behavior simulator in conjunction with a realistic security matching system. Virtual Market is then leveraged as an interactive training environment for the RL-based portfolio agent. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves out-of-sample portfolio performance by 4%, which is superior to other generalization strategies.  © 2013 IEEE.},

This paper introduces a novel algorithm based on the classical Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm and Deep Residual Shrinkage Neural Network for portfolio management. In this algorithm, the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators framework put forward by Jiang et al. is adopted in the policy function.

We use the cryptocurrency market in this research to assess the efficacy of our strategy with eight traditional portfolio management strategies as well as Jiang et al.'s reinforcement learning strategy. In our experiments, the Accumulated Yield is used to reflect the profit of the algorithm. Despite having a high commission rate of 0.25% in back-Tests, results show that our algorithm can achieve 44.5%, 105.4%, and 148.8% returns in three different 50-days back-Tests, which is five times more than the profit of other non-reinforcement learning strategies and Jiang et al.'s strategy. Furthermore, the Sharpe ratio demonstrates that the extra reward per unit risk of the our strategy is still better than other traditional portfolio management strategies and Jiang et al.'s strategy by at least 50% in different time horizons.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The asset management of an insurance company is more complex than traditional portfolio management due to the presence of obligations that the insurance company must fulfill toward the clients. These obligations, commonly referred to as liabilities, are payments whose magnitude and occurrence are a byproduct of insurance contracts with the clients, and of portfolio performances. In particular, while clients must be refunded in case of adverse events, such as car accidents or death, they also contribute to a common financial portfolio to earn annual returns. Customer withdrawals might increase whenever these returns are too low or, in the presence of an annual minimum guaranteed, the company might have to integrate the difference. Hence, in this context, any investment strategy cannot omit the inter-dependency between financial assets and liabilities. To deal with this problem, we present a stochastic model that combines portfolio returns with the liabilities generated by the insurance products offered by the company. Furthermore, we propose a risk-adjusted optimization problem to maximize the capital of the company over a pre-determined time horizon. Since traditional financial tools are inadequate for such a setting, we develop the model as a Markov Decision Process. In this way, we can use Reinforcement Learning algorithms to solve the underlying optimization problem. Finally, we provide experiments that show how the optimal asset allocation can be found by training an agent with the algorithm Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {To diversify, investors should avoid adding assets to their portfolio when their prices exhibit high correlation. Industry diversification is a common portfolio diversification method. It is likely that the notion of investing across different industries can help achieve portfolio diversification, as companies in different industries are likely to have different revenue and cost drivers. However, results across various studies have been mixed. This study seeks to identify a novel application to diversify portfolios to overcome the mixed results of industry diversification, through the use of unsupervised time series clustering-based machine learning technique. There are various ways of clustering time-series, namely shape-based, model-based and feature-based. Feature-based approach faces limitation for the need of equal-length feature vectors, and model-based approach faces limitation in terms of scalability. In this research, a shape-based clustering approach, which overcomes the aforementioned limitations, and specifically agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm (AHC-DTW), with dynamic time warping as the distance measure, is utilized to perform diversification. AHC-DTW allows clustering to be conducted across different temporal lengths, many-to-one point comparison to measure distances rather than one-to-one point comparison for euclidean distance. Further, AHC-DTW remains robust with scaling and shifting, unlike for instance, euclidean approach which requires clustering of the same time length, and is highly sensitive to outliers, noise, and transformations. The shape-based clustering approach implemented seeks to match the shapes of time series data as closely as possible. Since shape-based clustering technique groups together cumulative stock returns that trends closely across time, it will be intuitive that investors investing in more than one stock in the same cluster will not be better off, in contrast to diversifying investments across different clusters. Research found clear outperformance of shaped-based cluster diversification against industry diversification. Annualized mean return improved by 598 basis points, and Sharpe performance measure improved by 337%. Further, research found that AHC-DTW clustering exhibited time persistency. These robust results suggest promise for industry practitioners in the utilization of shape-based cluster diversification for enhanced investment portfolio performance. © 2021 University of Bahrain.

	abstract = {Matured hydrocarbon fields are continuously deteriorating and selection of well interventions turn into critical task with an objective of achieving higher business value. Time consuming simulation models and classical decision-making approach making it difficult to rapidly identify the best underperforming, potential rig and rig-less candidates. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to demonstrate the automated solution with data driven machine learning (ML) & AI assisted workflows to prioritize the intervention opportunities that can deliver higher sustainable oil rate and profitability. The solution consists of establishing a customized database using inputs from various sources including production & completion data, flat files and simulation models. Automation of Data gathering along with technical and economical calculations were implemented to overcome the repetitive and less added value tasks. Second layer of solution includes configuration of tailor-made workflows to conduct the analysis of well performance, logs, output from simulation models (static reservoir model, well models) along with historical events. Further these workflows were combination of current best practices of an integrated assessment of subsurface opportunities through analytical computations along with machine learning driven techniques for ranking the well intervention opportunities with consideration of complexity in implementation. The automated process outcome is a comprehensive list of future well intervention candidates like well conversion to gas lift, water shutoff, stimulation and nitrogen kick-off opportunities. The opportunity ranking is completed with AI assisted supported scoring system that takes input from technical, financial and implementation risk scores. In addition, intuitive dashboards are built and tailored with the involvement of management and engineering departments to track the opportunity maturation process. The advisory system has been implemented and tested in a giant mature field with over 300 wells. The solution identified more techno-economical feasible opportunities within hours instead of weeks or months with reduced risk of failure resulting into an improved economic success rate. The first set of opportunities under implementation and expected a gain of 2.5MM$ with in first one year and expected to have reoccurring gains in subsequent years. The ranked opportunities are incorporated into the business plan, RMP plans and drilling & workover schedule in accordance to field development targets. This advisory system helps in maximizing the profitability and minimizing CAPEX and OPEX. This further maximizes utilization of production optimization models by 30%. Currently the system was implemented in one of ADNOC Onshore field and expected to be scaled to other fields based on consistent value creation. A hybrid approach of physics and machine learning based solution led to the development of automated workflows to identify and rank the inactive strings, well conversion to gas lift candidates & underperforming candidates resulting into successful cost optimization and production gain. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

For the former, they apply supervised learning algorithms, including the random forest, based on a large macroeconomic database to estimate the probability of an upcoming recession or a stock market contraction. Out-of-sample tests show the reliability of these predictions, especially for recessions in the United States, over the period 1973 to 2020.

	abstract = {Our work analyzes the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) research portfolios of six large research funding organizations from the United States [National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF)]; Europe [European Commission (EC) and European Research Council (ERC)]; China [National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC)]; and Japan [Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)]. The data for this analysis is based on 127,000 research clusters (RCs) that are derived from 1.4 billion citation links between 104.8 million documents from four databases (Dimensions, Microsoft Academic Graph, Web of Science, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure). Of these RCs, 600 large clusters are associated with AI/ML topics, and 161 of these AI/ML RCs are expected to experience extreme growth between May 2020 and May 2023. Funding acknowledgments (in the corpus of the 104.9 million documents) are used to characterize the overall AI/ML research portfolios of each organization. NNSFC is the largest funder of AI/ML research and disproportionately funds computer vision. The EC, RC, and JSPS focus more efforts on natural language processing and robotics. The NSF and ERC are more focused on fundamental advancement of AI/ML rather than on applications. They are more likely to participate in the RCs that are expected to have extreme growth. NIH funds the largest relative share of general AI/ML research papers (meaning in areas other than computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics). We briefly describe how insights such as these could be applied to portfolio management decision-making. Copyright © 2021 Rahkovsky, Toney, Boyack, Klavans and Murdick.},

	abstract = {Most existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based portfolio management models do not take into account the market conditions, which limits their performance in risk-return balancing. In this paper, we propose DeepTrader, a deep RL method to optimize the investment policy. In particular, to tackle the risk-return balancing problem, our model embeds macro market conditions as an indicator to dynamically adjust the proportion between long and short funds, to lower the risk of market fluctuations, with the negative maximum drawdown as the reward function. Additionally, the model involves a unit to evaluate individual assets, which learns dynamic patterns from historical data with the price rising rate as the reward function. Both temporal and spatial dependencies between assets are captured hierarchically by a specific type of graph structure. Particularly, we find that the estimated causal structure best captures the interrelationships between assets, compared to industry classification and correlation. The two units are complementary and integrated to generate a suitable portfolio which fits the market trend well and strikes a balance between return and risk effectively. Experiments on three well-known stock indexes demonstrate the superiority of DeepTrader in terms of risk-gain criteria. © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

	abstract = {Portfolio management via reinforcement learning is at the forefront of fintech research, which explores how to optimally reallocate a fund into different financial assets over the long term by trial-and-error. Existing methods are impractical since they usually assume each reallocation can be finished immediately and thus ignoring the price slippage as part of the trading cost. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical reinforced stock trading system for portfolio management (HRPM). Concretely, we decompose the trading process into a hierarchy of portfolio management over trade execution and train the corresponding policies. The high-level policy gives portfolio weights at a lower frequency to maximize the long term profit and invokes the low-level policy to sell or buy the corresponding shares within a short time window at a higher frequency to minimize the trading cost. We train two levels of policies via pre-training scheme and iterative training scheme for data efficiency. Extensive experimental results in the U.S. market and the China market demonstrate that HRPM achieves significant improvement against many state-of-the-art approaches. © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

	abstract = {Combinatorial optimization has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace to transportation planning and economics. The goal is to find an optimal solution among a finite set of possibilities. The well-known challenge one faces with combinatorial optimization is the state-space explosion problem: the number of possibilities grows exponentially with the problem size, which makes solving intractable for large problems. In the last years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown its promise for designing good heuristics dedicated to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. However, current approaches have an important shortcoming: they only provide an approximate solution with no systematic ways to improve it or to prove optimality. In another context, constraint programming (CP) is a generic tool to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Based on a complete search procedure, it will always find the optimal solution if we allow an execution time large enough. A critical design choice, that makes CP non-trivial to use in practice, is the branching decision, directing how the search space is explored. In this work, we propose a general and hybrid approach, based on DRL and CP, for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The core of our approach is based on a dynamic programming formulation, that acts as a bridge between both techniques. We experimentally show that our solver is efficient to solve three challenging problems: the traveling salesman problem with time windows, the 4-moments portfolio optimization problem, and the 0-1 knapsack problem. Results obtained show that the framework introduced outperforms the stand-alone RL and CP solutions, while being competitive with industrial solvers.

Like Kelly, Pruitt, and Su (KPS, 2019), our model allows for latent factors and factor exposures that depend on covariates such as asset characteristics. But, unlike the linearity assumption of KPS, we model factor exposures as a flexible nonlinear function of covariates. Our model retrofits the workhorse unsupervised dimension reduction device from the machine learning literature – autoencoder neural networks – to incorporate information from covariates along with returns themselves. This delivers estimates of nonlinear conditional exposures and the associated latent factors. Furthermore, our machine learning framework imposes the economic restriction of no-arbitrage. Our autoencoder asset pricing model delivers out-of-sample pricing errors that are far smaller (and generally insignificant) compared to other leading factor models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Nickel is a key competitive material source with commodities and economic characteristics, the price volatility of which would influence shareholder's decisions. For this reason, an accurate pattern prediction of nickel prices is a crucial concern for the strategic planning of investors in the nickel trade; however, the conventional neural network models are not effective in terms of predictive performance and suitability. So, Gaussian Processes-Long Short-Term Memory (GP-LSTM) model was suggested to learn the LSTM kernels and predict the nickel prices. However, this kernel function representation was not plenty for a huge amount of data captured from various sources. Also, it cannot completely learn dynamic, composite and structural data attributes. Therefore in this article, a Multiple-Kernel LSTM (MKLSTM) network model is proposed for learning the huge amount of data and predicting the nickel prices efficiently. The core objective of this MKLSTM model is to resolve the difficulty of adding LSTM and multiple kernel functions using data from nickel industries. This model is applied to find the significant attributes for representing suitable data. Also, the proper larger kernels for learning dynamic and structural data attributes are selected by constructing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By using the selected kernels, the MKLSTM is learned to predict the nickel price and its fluctuations. At last, the experimental results exhibit the performance of MKLSTM using the nickel price database compared to the LSTM and GP-LSTM models. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Among traditional volatility measurements, normal covariance estimators are not able to distinguish the downside risk and upside gains of asset return, while traditional lower partial moment estimators are asymmetric and impossible to sum up. Therefore, this paper introduces a new risk measurement called realized semi-covariance (RSCOV) to conduct volatility forecasting and portfolio optimization. Based on decomposition of realized covariance matrix, we test it on two common diversification investing strategies, equally-weighted risk contribution (ERC) strategy and global minimum variance (GMV) strategy. To perform forecasting, we adopt online weighted ensemble (OWE) algorithm in machine learning domain to boost the out-of-sample performance of HAR-RV. Compared to existing covariance or realized covariance, we find that realized downside semi-covariance matrix, that only contains information about negative volatility, can be used to better balance the risk contribution of assets in portfolio. Then, using high-frequency data of A share market spanning from 2011 to 2018, empirical result shows that our OWE-HAR-RV can outperform HAR-RV in monthly prediction. Lower RSCOV can be applied to ensure risk parity and minimum variance portfolio strategies to achieve better allocated asset weights and lower maximum loss while maintaining certain portfolio return. © 2021, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

Design / Methodology / Approach: Initially, a multiple-case study approach is applied embracing 15 Brazilian companies. Then, a survey is conducted in the same organizations to deepen the investigation. Two recognized S&OP frameworks from the literature are used to structure the research. Results: Some of the main research findings include: some companies consider “Data Gathering” a normal task and no longer a S&OP cycle step; some organizations include a new step one named “Portfolio Management”, preceding “Demand Planning” to leverage step two’s outcomes; there are improvement opportunities identified in “Pre-meeting” and “Executive Meeting” steps regarding capacity to simulate different scenarios from a financial perspective; and most of the studied companies do not adopt a S&OP software facing limitations to manage information and perform what-if analysis. Limitations of the investigation: Only companies located in Brazil are investigated. Practical implications: The study provides useful information for practitioners on the characterization of the S&OP process, implementation challenges, and improvement opportunities. Originality / Value: The paper applies different research methods (multiple-case study and survey) and two recognized frameworks from the literature in the study of the S&OP process performed by 15 companies, providing a broad characterization of the processes implemented and valuable findings about challenges and improvement opportunities.

	abstract = {The majority of Italian schools (70%) were built in the absence of any legislation related to energy efficiency, and therefore have very low energy performance due to aging or poor quality of construction. An energy retrofit of this building stock is needed to meet the current European goals on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The retrofit is also needed in order to guarantee adequate comfort levels in indoor spaces and good conditions for learning and educational activities, that are often not reached in poor quality constructions. This work presents the results of an interdisciplinary study related to the energy requalification of a school located in Ostia, near Rome in Italy, built in the 1960s with a steel structure and Eternit infill. The scope of the analysis is to verify the economic and environmental effectiveness of four proposed retrofit interventions concerning the replacement of fixtures and the installation of an insulating coat. The current thermal transmittance of the walls was evaluated through thermofluximetric measurements conducted in situ; dynamic simulations were performed to determine the current energy performance and the energy performances following the four proposed retrofit scenarios. Energy and carbon payback times were evaluated (by means of the life cycle analysis (LCA) approach) and the economic value was determined for each of the four proposed retrofits, using a probabilistic approach. The results show that the replacement of windows is the most convenient intervention from all points of view. The study provides evidence that an assessment of schools’ energy retrofits should include both economic and life cycle aspects. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The final goal is enhancing the financial performance of the investment product, which in our case refers to a portfolio of equities. We adopt a combination of algorithms, capable of hand-ling high-level abstraction, to study short- and long-term patterns emerging from the analysis of financial factors and market signals. The core of the model adopted to perform the prediction is composed of two independent entities, analyzing short-term dynamics and capturing long-term trends respectively. This adjustment helps us improve the predictive ability of the model in a dynamic environment, where high volatility and noise are intrinsic features. Lastly, we employ an ensemble algorithm that performs an intelligent weighting of each agent’s output. This method allows us to identify the best stocks in terms of performance and to successfully implement quarter-long hold strategies that outperform the selected universe’s equities return benchmark. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Modern portfolio theory is closely linked to the concept of diversification. As a result, the most important decision of investor is to make his allocation asset portfolio more and more efficient. Thus, for a given level of risk, the investor seeks to maximise the expected return and minimise the risk by constructing an optimal portfolio. In this paper, we seek to know how unsupervised learning can be used to define the asset allocation strategy. In this sense, we have carried out a comparative study between a so-called classical portfolio, which is based on the modern portfolio theory (i.e. a portfolio constructed on the basis of numerical optimisation) and a portfolio based on unsupervised learning. The aim of this comparison is to look for the best performing method that can give the best asset allocation. Our findings show that the optimal strategy for an ambitious investor lies to the unsupervised learning algorithms that allow a dynamic analysis of portfolio. However, the optimal strategy for a risk-averse investor is still the numerical optimisation approach. Copyright © 2021– All Rights Reserved},

	abstract = {This Article offers a novel perspective on the implications of increasingly autonomous and “black box” algorithms, within the ramification of algorithmic trading, for the integrity of capital markets. Artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly its subfield of machine learning (ML) methods have gained immense popularity among the great public and achieved tremendous success in many real-life applications by leading to vast efficiency gains. In the financial trading domain, ML can augment human capabilities in price prediction, dynamic portfolio optimization, and other financial decision-making tasks. However, thanks to constant progress in the ML technology, the prospect of increasingly capable and autonomous agents to delegate operational tasks and even decision-making is now beyond mere imagination, thus opening up the possibility for approximating (truly) autonomous trading agents anytime soon. Given these spectacular developments, this Article argues that such autonomous algorithmic traders may involve significant risks to market integrity, independent from their human experts, thanks to self-learning capabilities offered by state-of-the-art and innovative ML methods. Using the proprietary trading industry as a case study, we explore emerging threats to the application of established market abuse laws in the event of algorithmic market abuse, by taking an interdisciplinary stance between financial regulation, law and economics, and computational finance. Specifically, our analysis focuses on two emerging market abuse risks by autonomous algorithms: market manipulation and “tacit” collusion. We explore their likelihood to arise in global capital markets and evaluate related social harm as forms of market failures. With these new risks in mind, this Article questions the adequacy of existing regulatory frameworks and enforcement mechanisms, as well as current legal rules on the governance of algorithmic trading, to cope with increasingly autonomous and ubiquitous algorithmic trading systems. We demonstrate how the “black box” nature of specific ML-powered algorithmic trading strategies can subvert existing market abuse laws, which are based upon traditional liability concepts and tests (such as “intent” and “causation”). We conclude by addressing the shortcomings of the present legal framework and develop a number of guiding principles to assist legal and policy reform in the spirit of promoting and safeguarding market integrity and safety. © 2021 University of Pennsylvania Law School.

In our framework, two Long Short-Term Memory neural networks and two fully connected neural networks are constructed. We also investigate the performance of our strategy with and without transaction costs. Experimentally, we choose eight US stocks consisting of four low-volatility stocks and four high-volatility stocks. We compare the compound annual return rate of our strategy against seven other strategies, e.g., Uniform Buy and Hold, Exponential Gradient and Universal Portfolios. In our case, the compound annual return rate is 14.12%, outperforming all other strategies. Furthermore, in terms of Sharpe Ratio (0.5988), our strategy is nearly 33% higher than that of the second-best performing strategy.  © 2021 IEEE.},

More general models with arbitrary state dynamics and endogenous volatilities lead to multidimensional systems of nonlinear, fully-coupled forward-backward SDEs. These fall outside the scope of known well-posedness results, but can be solved numerically using the simulation-based deep-learning approach of Han, Jentzen, and E (2018). In a calibration to time series of prices and trading volume, realistic liquidity premia are accompanied by a moderate increase in volatility.

This subjective information is particularly relevant in the finance domain as opinions and speculation may influence investment decisions and, consequently, affect asset prices. State-of-the-art sentiment classification methods in machine learning use contextual word representations from pre-trained BERT language models and several papers have fine-tuned BERT for the sentiment classification of financial texts. However, these preceding studies have not considered extensive real-world data sets or provided a robust assessment of whether the sentiment scores derived from BERT predict asset prices. This paper addresses these limitations by fine-tuning BERT to analyse the sentiment across an extensive set of news articles published by the Wall Street Journal. The analysis also extends beyond financial news stories, assessing the sentiment in economic and national news articles. An econometric evaluation of the sentiment scores shows that financial news sentiment is statistically significant in predicting daily market returns, while longer-term economic news sentiment predicts monthly returns. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Robust portfolio optimization theory is an es-sential foundation for modern financial modeling, which is a well-studied but not fully conquered territory. Conservatism is one of the most discussed issues by numerous scholars. To obtain a robust portfolio model with satisfactory perfor-mance, we propose the hybrid robust mean-variance portfolio model constrained with different ellipsoidal uncertainty sets in this paper. Additionally, skewness is also considered in the objective function. Preselection is designed for picking out the high-quality risky assets, where two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, are involved. In the numerical experiments, the US 48 industry data set from Kenneth R. French is employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid portfolio models. The comparative results between the proposed hybrid models and baseline portfolio models (equal-weighted model, mean-variance model, mean-variance-skewness model) show that the proposed hybrid robust mean-variance portfolios considering skewness with preselection beat the baseline strategies by a clear margin. Also, the actual effectiveness of skewness in the hybrid robust models is analyzed. © 2021, International Association of Engineers. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new class of risk measures and the corresponding risk minimizing portfolio optimization problem. Instead of measuring the expected deviation of a daily return from a single target value, we propose to measure its deviation from a range of values centered on the single target value. By relaxing the definition of deviation, the proposed risk measure is robust to the variation of data input and thus the resulting risk-minimizing portfolio has a lower turnover rate and is resilient to outliers. To construct a practical portfolio, we propose to impose an (Formula presented.) -norm constraint on the portfolio weights to stabilize the portfolio's out-of-sample performance. We show that for some cases of our proposed range-based risk measures, the corresponding portfolio optimization can be recast as a support vector regression problem. This allows us to tap into the machine learning literature on support vector regression and effectively solve the portfolio optimization problem even in high dimensions. Moreover, we present theoretical results on the robustness of our range-based risk minimizing portfolios. Simulation and empirical studies are conducted to examine the out-of-sample performance of the proposed portfolios. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Firstly, we start with the two well-known classical models of asset pricing, CAPM model and APT model, which describe relationship between the expected return of effective portfolio and risk assets in the capital market. That is the basis of asset pricing theory. Then, the key point locates on summarizing the applicability and limitations of different machine-learning models. Thirdly, by using out-of-sample R2 to measure the performance of each model, we examine how machine learning can be used to predict the risk premium. At the same time, it is demonstrated that the two best-performance methods with nonlinear predictor interactions are random forests and neural networks. Finally, we suggest the future research trends for the application of machine learning method in asset price prediction. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The financial crisis in 2008 highlighted the demise of the most widely used risk measure, Value-at-Risk. Unlike the Basel-IV-required Conditional VaR model of Rockafellar & Uryasev, VaR ignores the possibility of abnormal returns and is not even coherent. Our novelty here is introducing an annual Desirability Value (DV) for each candidate company before creating a portfolio of their stocks. We utilize only the downside changes in DVs in CVaR-optimization instead of simply utilizing annual stock-price returns. The DV of a company is the perpendicular distance from the fundamental position of that company to the best separating hyperplane that separates profitable companies from losers during training. Thus, we introduce a novel coherent surrogate risk measure, Conditional-Desirability-Value-at-Risk (CDVaR). Our machine-learning-fundamental-analysis-based CDVaR portfolio optimization results are comparable to those of mainstream price-returns-based CVaR optimizers. We show that these two optimal portfolios and the market index, BIST100 (all three portfolios in USD terms), are cointegrated. When backtested using in-sample data, the resulting Mean-Reverting Portfolio, labelled MRP, returns an APR of 5.26 (in USD) over nine years. In contrast, the market index produces negative returns over the same period. Since the existence of cointegration points to a long-term trend, the fact that this conclusion comes from in-sample data seems to be acceptable. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Technical analysis aims to predict market movement by examining historical data through statistical procedures. Nevertheless, it is sensitive to the parameter it is working with. An optimization problem is defined to tune technical analysis parameters by minimizing an error metric for stock return prediction. Differential Evolution is a metaheuristic that provides good solutions to an optimization problem, searching for the optimal combination of parameters for technical analyzers to predict Mexican stock returns. For the application of the metaheuristic, an objective function based on a Random Forest prediction is used. The literature has proven the use of different macroeconomic variables (MEV) to determine expected returns, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or different Arbitrage Pricing Theories (APT). This paper considers the influence of macroeconomic factors on stock prices; it is approached with a Granger-causality test on the different sector indexes of the Mexican stock exchange, to see the relationship they hold. Instead of supervising the error from the machine learning models, it is proposed to analyze their performance in a more realistic scenario, by simulating a portfolio. Constructing a diversified portfolio is a smart way to allocate your money parting from the expected returns computed, still, other relevant factors may alter its performance. This work shows the performance of different portfolios constructed from the same expected return computations, reaching excess returns over the benchmarks of the 12% in the 3 years analyzed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

It entails building a portfolio of stocks maximizing the expected return in the medium- or long-term while minimizing investments' risk. Diversification is the most common strategy to manage risk in financial investments. It entails spreading bets across multiple assets, typically by picking stocks from different financial sectors. This paper presents a time series clustering-based strategy to improve the effectiveness of stock diversification across sectors. It analyzes the cross-correlation among price series in order to identify groups of stocks belonging to different sectors that unexpectedly show similar trends as well as dissimilarities among stocks of the same sector. The diversification strategy has been integrated into a state-of-the-art itemset-based approach to stock portfolio generation.

This study uses Basic Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning agents who will learn market patterns to trade in financial assets to maximize the fund value, using portfolio returns net of transaction costs as the learning criteria. 15 Indian financial assets covering Equity Sectoral Indices, Government Security Indices and Gold spot prices were chosen and a Reinforcement Learning agent was trained on each of them. The Reinforcement Learning agents were given Simple Moving Averages, 52-Week Stochastic Indicator and Price Change Momentum Indicators for their respective financial assets to train on. Testing was conducted for the Year 2019 and evaluation of the performance was done using the annual returns net of transaction costs, Max Drawdown and Standard Deviation, in comparison to the benchmarks. Most of the agents have been able to reduce the Max Drawdown and Standard Deviation while there is further scope to improve on the Fund Performance. The study has been successful in implementing a basic Q-Learning algorithm for Portfolio optimization to reduce the downside risk and the study would lay the foundation to perform further research on this Subject to maximize wealth creation from Financial Markets.

Accurate tracking with a sparse portfolio is extensively studied as a classic finance problem. However in practice, a tracking portfolio must also be diverse in order to minimise risk-a requirement which has only been dealt with by ad-hoc methods before. We introduce the first index tracking method that explicitly optimises both diversity and sparsity in a single joint framework. Diversity is realised by a regulariser based on pairwise similarity of assets, and we demonstrate that learning similarity from data can outperform some existing heuristics. Finally, we show that the way we model diversity leads to an easy solution for sparsity, allowing both constraints to be optimised easily and efficiently. we run out-of-sample back-testing for a long interval of 15 years (2003-2018), and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 2020 IEEE.},

Design/methodology/approach: Based on comment data of individual stock from the Snowball, a thermal optimal path method is employed to analyze the lead–lag relationship between investor attention (IA) and the stock price. And machine learning algorithms, including SVM and BP neural network, are used to predict the prices of certain kind of stock. Findings: It turns out that the lead–lag relationships between IA and the stock price change dynamically. Forecasting based on investor behavior is more accurate only when the IA of the stock is stably leading its price change most of the time. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this paper is that it studies China’s stock market only; however, different conclusions could be drawn for other financial markets or mature stock markets. Practical implications: As for the implications, the new tool could improve the prediction accuracy of the model, thus have practical significance for stock selection and dynamic portfolio management. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first few research works that introduce individual investor data into portfolio risk management. The new tool put forward in this study can capture the dynamic interplay between IA and stock price change, which help investors identify and control the risk of their portfolios. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) techniques have been used to optimize asset trading systems and have achieved outstanding results. However, the majority of the previous work has been dedicated to systems with discrete action spaces. To address the challenge of continuous action and multi-dimensional state spaces, we propose the so called Stacked Deep Dynamic Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (SDDRRL) architecture to construct a real-time optimal portfolio. The algorithm captures the up-to-date market conditions and rebalances the portfolio accordingly. Under this general vision, Sharpe ratio, which is one of the most widely accepted measures of risk-adjusted returns, has been used as a performance metric. Additionally, the performance of most machine learning algorithms highly depends on their hyperparameter settings. Therefore, we equipped SDDRRL with the ability to find the best possible architecture topology using an automated Gaussian Process (GP) with Expected Improvement (EI) as an acquisition function. This allows us to select the best architectures that maximizes the total return while respecting the cardinality constraints. Finally, our system was trained and tested in an online manner for 20 successive rounds with data for ten selected stocks from different sectors of the S&P 500 from January 1st, 2013 to July 31st, 2017. The experiments reveal that the proposed SDDRRL achieves superior performance compared to three benchmarks: the rolling horizon Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) model, the rolling horizon risk parity model, and the uniform buy-and-hold (UBAH) index. © 2019},

While risk-sensitive formulations for Markov decision processes studied so far focus on the distribution of the cumulative reward as a whole, we aim at learning policies sensitive to the uncertain/stochastic nature of the rewards, which has the advantage of being conceptually more meaningful in some cases. To this end, we present a new decomposition of the randomness contained in the cumulative reward based on the Doob decomposition of a stochastic process, and introduce a new conceptual tool-the chaotic variation-which can rigorously be interpreted as the risk measure of the martingale component associated to the cumulative reward process. We innovate on the reinforcement learning side by incorporating this new risk-sensitive approach into model-free algorithms, both policy gradient and value function based, and illustrate its relevance on grid world and portfolio optimization problems.  © 2020 ACM.},

With high-frequency data availability in the last few decades, new volatility models have been proposed that make use of realized volatility measures. These models have been empirically shown to provide better performance when compared with classical low-frequency approaches. In this paper, we propose a methodology combining an MLP neural network with heterogeneous autoregressive models for daily forecasting of the covariance matrix of a portfolio and for dynamically allocating optimal weights. Using Cholesky decomposition we guarantee the positive definite estimates. We used real historical data of 5 stocks of the Brazilian market in our experiments and the results demonstrated statistically superior forecasts compared with the baselines HAR, HARQ, ARFIMA, and DCC, using the Model Confidence Set test. We also evaluate the performance of the portfolios using the matrix estimates from the different models as parameters to Global Minimum Variance Portfolio. Our approach achieved the smallest values of portfolio variance compared with the baselines. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As a hot topic in the financial engineering, the portfolio optimization aims to increase investors’ wealth. In this paper, a portfolio management system based on deep-reinforcement learning is proposed. In contrast to inflexible traditional methods, the proposed system achieves a better trading strategy through Reinforcement learning. The reward signal of Reinforcement learning is updated by action weights from Deep learning networks. Low price, high price and close price constitute the inputs, but the importance of these three features is quite different. Traditional methods and the classical CNN can't deal with these three features separately, but in our method, a designed depth convolution is proposed to deal with these three features separately. In a virtual currency market, the price rise only occurs in a flash. Traditional methods and CNN networks can't accurately judge the critical time. In order to solve this problem, a three-dimensional attention gating network is proposed and it gives higher weights on rising moments and assets. Under different market conditions, the proposed system achieves more substantial returns and greatly improves the Sharpe ratios. The short-term risk index of the proposed system is lower than those of the traditional algorithms. Simulation results show that the traditional algorithms (including Best, CRP, PAMR, CWMR and CNN) are unable to perform as well as our approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

We specify the representative agent's learning process and state beliefs, and apply this utility model to a consumption-based asset pricing model. When the dividends follow hidden Markov regime-switching processes, and the representative agent has ambiguous beliefs about the hidden state, we derive the implication of ambiguity for asset pricing, the optimal consumption and portfolio selections. It is shown that ambiguity aversion, learning under ambiguity and belief updating play key roles in asset pricing. The pessimism of ambiguity averse agent distorts his belief by attaching more weight on the pricing kernel in bad times, so that his investment strategy is more conservative. This pessimistic behavior helps to spread and amplify the impact on consumption growth and generate equity premium that changes over time. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

Within the present research, the features of its regulation and diversification were highlighted. Moreover, the study outlined the work specifics of new insurance companies and InsurTech startups in domestic realities. Despite higher possibilities of supply chain disruptions, enterprises in APAC exhibit lesser investment in the supply chain industry because of their lack of knowledge on the same and their reluctance to pay high premiums.

DDPG is a model-free, off-policy actor-critic method that can learn policies in high-dimensional and continuous action and state spaces, like the ones normally found in financial market environments. The proposed day trading system was tested in B3 - Brazil Stock Exchange, an important and understudied market, especially considering the application of DRL techniques to alpha generation. A series of experiments were performed from the beginning of 2017 until the end of 2019 and compared with ten benchmarks, including Ibovespa, the most important Brazilian market index, and the stock portfolios suggested by the main Brazilian banks and brokers during these years. The results were evaluated considering return and risk metrics and showed that the proposed method outperformed the benchmarks by a huge margin. The best results obtained by the algorithm had a cumulative percentage return of 311% in three years, with an annual average maximum drawdown around 19%. © 2020 IEEE.},

According to the research, entity enterprises in Henan Province are of huge differences in financial asset allocation and in general, the configuration level is not high, and the main business is facing lower operating incomes. From the perspective of different industries, financial asset allocation of enterprises in the manufacturing industry presents U-shaped relations with the development of main business, and when the level of financial asset allocation in enterprises reaches to 10.47%, incomes obtained by financial asset allocation can promote the development of main business, but the above effect isn't obvious in other industries. The research conclusion made in the paper is that entity enterprises can benefit more by making reasonable investment decisions, improving the utilization rate of idle funds, perfecting the effectiveness of financial market, and depositing into financial institutions, and these effects can provide the major basis to realize "the mutual promotion of finance and industry". © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The first issue covers the entire production chain “from orders to prices” by realistically modeling stock exchanges’ microstructure (e.g., NASDAQ and Xetra). Specifically, the authors show how data-driven research can model decisions to place orders and to generate prices by matching orders accordingly. The other issue is price interconnectedness at markets by networks. The authors show that interactions shape a market’s performance. Emergence comprises the interactions at markets; as such, the collective may not be equal to the sum of individual activities. As a consequence, the assumption that markets are in equilibrium and that arbitrage opportunities do not exist can be replaced by more realistic working hypotheses. The authors show with the two examples that market participants interact, learn, and trade. These individual interactions can be described as organized complexity. Whereas calculus may not support explicit modeling of interactions, the age of big data permits their modeling and application of innovative concepts, such as network solutions for asset allocation, which can be modeled using machine learning. This article illustrates that assertion with concrete examples. © 2020 With Intelligence Ltd.},

	abstract = {A precise prediction of Bitcoin price is an important aspect of digital financial markets because it improves the valuation of an asset belonging to a decentralized control market. Numerous studies have studied the accuracy of models from a set of factors. Hence, previous literature shows how models for the prediction of Bitcoin suffer from poor performance capacity and, therefore, more progress is needed on predictive models, and they do not select the most significant variables. This paper presents a comparison of deep learning methodologies for forecasting Bitcoin price and, therefore, a new prediction model with the ability to estimate accurately. A sample of 29 initial factors was used, which has made possible the application of explanatory factors of different aspects related to the formation of the price of Bitcoin. To the sample under study, different methods have been applied to achieve a robust model, namely, deep recurrent convolutional neural networks, which have shown the importance of transaction costs and difficulty in Bitcoin price, among others. Our results have a great potential impact on the adequacy of asset pricing against the uncertainties derived from digital currencies, providing tools that help to achieve stability in cryptocurrency markets. Our models offer high and stable success results for a future prediction horizon, something useful for asset valuation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The student-managed investment fund (SMIF) program at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB), was launched in 1995 with one portfolio worth $50,000. In the two decades since then, the program has grown to include three portfolios with a combined value of more than $700,000, managed on behalf of three different clients. The purpose of this paper is to describe the creation, evolution and growth of the program including the development of the new quantitative approach and its subsequent implementation. The paper also discusses the ongoing organizational, educational and investment-management challenges associated with the program. Design/methodology/approach: The paper includes a description of the development and evolution of the program along with a discussion of the investment results for one of its three portfolios. Findings: The paper finds: the new quantitative approach implemented in the program is effective as insurance against “black swan” events; and SMIF-type programs can provide learning experiences both for students and faculty members. Practical implications: The paper explains the practical application of the new quantitative approach as well as the educational benefits of a SMIF-type program. Originality/value: The paper provides insight into the structure of CSULB’s SMIF program and discusses a unique quantitative approach to asset allocation and security selection. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this paper sign correlations and the autocorrelations of the absolute values of the returns are used to show that the returns are non-normal with time-varying volatility. We use the recently proposed data-driven exponentially weighted moving average (DDEWMA) volatility model to estimate the covariance matrix of asset returns in Markowitz portfolio optimization. Empirical results with big data (consists of 444 stocks for a period of 7 years downloaded from Yahoo Finance) show that the proposed DDEWMA variance covariance matrix model outperforms (larger Sharpe ratio) the model with empirical variance covariance matrix. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, vending machines have seen increasing levels of popularity. In a fast-paced world where convenience and accessibility of products is highly sought after the vending industry has provided a suitable solution. Although the economic impact of the vending industry is indisputable, it is not without challenges, especially when it comes to the efficiency of the vending logistics operations. The optimisation of logistic vending machine systems is decidedly complex. Product allocation to columns in a vending machine, replenishment points of products, product thresholds at vending machines, and vehicle routes for inventory replenishments are all essential challenges in vending machine system management and operation. If all facets of the problem were to be addressed, it would require techniques such as forecasting, machine learning, data mining, combinatorial optimization and vehicle routing, among others. In the past, these approaches have been explored individually despite their intrinsic interdependence within the problem. This paper aims to help to fill in this gap and proposes a model for the optimisation of product allocation within a vending machine under the constraint of fixed restocking instances. The optimal product allocation is based on the definition of product profitability which accounts for the net revenue earned after the cost of restock, as opposed to the revenue earned until first stock-out to prevent arbitrary extension of the stock-out period. The whole approach is encompassed in the simulation-optimisation framework that utilises a Genetic Algorithm, with fitness evaluated as simulated revenue, to determine the optimal product allocation. The acceptable threshold of missed sales for a machine is also determined as a means to make intelligent restocking decisions. Overall, the proposed approach allows the strengths of mathematically robust optimization algorithms and the implementation of analytic solutions to be combined and applied to realistic scenarios where uncertainty may rule out some high quality analytic solutions. It respects problem intricacies proper to vending and addresses the interdependence between routing and portfolio optimisation. The proposal is application-driven and stems from a collaboration with an industry partner. The model is validated against an authentic data set supplied by the partner. The case study results revealed a network-wide improvement in net revenue of approximately 3.4%, with varied efficacy based on machine popularity. The method of optimisation was found to be significantly more effective for higher performing machines, with median improvements as high as 6%. Our framework based on the optimization-simulation model yields clear benefits to vending logistics operations management. The simulation component provides the decision maker with a more comprehensive view on the actual implementation of the solution. Effectively, the joint use of simulation and optimization methods provides managers with enhanced information to help decide on both: (i) the most beneficial product portfolio, and (ii) the quality of the proposed restocking schedules. Simulation-optimisation based approach is a powerful technique used to address stochastic problems. However, it was yet to be applied specifically to logistic vending machine systems. © 2019},

These inter-correlations can provide invaluable information to be further leveraged to improve the overall forecasting performances. However, most previous works focus on the forecasting task of one single stock, which easily ignore the valuable information in others. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a jointly forecasting approach to process the time series of multiple related stocks simultaneously, using multi-task learning framework. In particular, this framework processes multiple forecasting tasks of different stocks simultaneously by sharing the information extracted based on latent inter-correlations. Meanwhile, each stock has their private encoding networks to keep their own information. Moreover, to dynamically balance private and shared information, we propose an attention based method, called Shared-private Attention, to optimally combine the shared and private information of stocks, which is inspired by the idea of Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Experimental results on the datasets of both stock and other domains demonstrate the proposed method can outperform other methods in forecasting performance. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Although several models have been proposed towards assisting machine learning (ML) tasks with quantum computers, a direct comparison of the expressive power and efficiency of classical versus quantum models for datasets originating from real-world applications is one of the key milestones towards a quantum ready era. Here, we take a first step towards addressing this challenge by performing a comparison of the widely used classical ML models known as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), against a recently proposed quantum model, now known as quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs). Both models address the same hard tasks in unsupervised generative modeling, with QCBMs exploiting the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and a candidate for near-term quantum computers, as experimentally demonstrated in three different quantum hardware architectures to date. To address the question of the performance of the quantum model on real-world classical data sets, we construct scenarios from a probabilistic version out of the well-known portfolio optimization problem in finance, by using time-series pricing data from asset subsets of the S&P500 stock market index. It is remarkable to find that, under the same number of resources in terms of parameters for both classical and quantum models, the quantum models seem to have superior performance on typical instances when compared with the canonical training of the RBMs. Our simulations are grounded on a hardware efficient realization of the QCBMs on ion-trap quantum computers, by using their native gate sets, and therefore readily implementable in near-term quantum devices. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Asset allocation is one of the key elements in financial market. The rationale is to invest on various assets that are different from each other. Lots of methods have been proposed to classify assets into different sub groups. But most of the ideas are either too macroscopic or too mathematical. These methods use lots of financial ideas that may contain human biases such as Merrill Lynch investment clock, or use some close-formed mathematical measurement that cannot easily incorporate financial insights. In this paper, we create diversified portfolios using clustering analysis. We use a nonlinear metric learning algorithm called ITML, which combines financial knowledge with mathematical metrics. It controls the amount of prior information used in the model and can be customized based on different scenarios. Back-testing results show that portfolios generated by our algorithm significantly outperform portfolios from random-selected ETF. ETF is Exchange Traded Fund, which can be traded easily like stocks. The indicators we used to evaluate the portfolios include return, correlation, volatility, Sharpe Ratio and maximum drawdown. The tests are based on Monte Carlo simulations and we allocate the assets based on risk parity. We use 149 most typical ETFs from global market including high/low risk bond ETFs, stock ETFs on Chinese, HK, Germany and US markets in different industry sectors, silver/gold ETFs and energy commodity ETFs. Moreover, features observation gives satisfying explanation for clustering results and shows our model offers good interpretability. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study examines how district governance and different school contexts in Denver’s portfolio management model affect shared leadership for learning. We define this as shared influence on instructional leadership and school-wide decision making, which research suggests have strong ties to student achievement and teacher commitment. Method: We analyze interview data from 53 administrators, teacher leaders, and teachers in eight case study schools and teacher surveys in 48 schools. In both data sets, we purposively sampled based on variance in school performance ratings and by school type (e.g., traditional public, standalone charter, charter management organization [CMO], and innovation schools). Findings: We find that perceptions of shared instructional leadership were generally high across the school contexts, though CMO and innovation schools had the highest perceptions in both the survey and case study data. Schools varied substantially in shared decision making, but innovation schools had higher average scores than other school models. Centralized policies and supports, alongside organizational visions spanning networks of schools, helped explain the enactment of shared leadership for learning. For example, schools within Denver’s “innovation” network shared a common vision of teacher empowerment, while CMOs that had more prescribed policies and practices across their schools had lower reported levels of shared decision making. Implications for Research and Practice: Portfolio management models that prioritize school-based autonomy and choice between different kinds of schools are proliferating in urban areas. Our study helps explain why and how shared leadership for learning differs between school models and explores important implications for this variation. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {The process of continuously reallocating funds into financial assets, aiming to increase the expected return of investment and minimizing the risk, is known as portfolio management. In this paper, a portfolio management framework is developed based on a deep reinforcement learning framework called DeepBreath. The DeepBreath methodology combines a restricted stacked autoencoder and a convolutional neural network (CNN) into an integrated framework. The restricted stacked autoencoder is employed in order to conduct dimensionality reduction and features selection, thus ensuring that only the most informative abstract features are retained. The CNN is used to learn and enforce the investment policy which consists of reallocating the various assets in order to increase the expected return on investment. The framework consists of both offline and online learning strategies: the former is required to train the CNN while the latter handles concept drifts i.e. a change in the data distribution resulting from unforeseen circumstances. These are based on passive concept drift detection and online stochastic batching. Settlement risk may occur as a result of a delay in between the acquisition of an asset and its payment failing to deliver the terms of a contract. In order to tackle this challenging issue, a blockchain is employed. Finally, the performance of the DeepBreath framework is tested with four test sets over three distinct investment periods. The results show that the return of investment achieved by our approach outperforms current expert investment strategies while minimizing the market risk. © 2020},

The implementation of this gamified experience was carried out in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with 122 students. They were quite satisfied with the gamified experience and recognized that the Portfolio Game Experience contributed to learning different PPM techniques and processes, especially those associated with project prioritization and selection. Moreover, 100% of the respondents would recommend the course to a colleague. By qualitatively analyzing students’ feedback, this study has found out that the Portfolio Game Experience provided the students the practical experience of actively learning what they have seen in theory. Students also highlighted typical game characteristics that contribute to their learning, like the fact that the game is fun, challenging, motivating and interactive.

	abstract = {Over the years, portfolio optimization remains an important decision-making strategy for investment. The most familiar and widely used approach in the field of portfolio optimization is the mean–variance framework introduced by Markowitz. Following this pioneering work, many researchers have extended this model to make it more practical and adapt to real-life problems. In this study, one of these extensions, the cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem, is considered. Cardinality constraints transform the quadratic optimization model into the mixed-integer quadratic programming problem, which is proved to be NP-Hard, making it harder to obtain an optimal solution within a reasonable time by using exact solution methodologies. Hence, the vast majority of the researchers have taken advantage of approximate algorithms to overcome arising computational difficulties. To develop an efficient solution approach for cardinality constrained portfolio optimization, in this study, a parallel variable neighborhood search algorithm combined with quadratic programming is proposed. While the variable neighborhood search algorithm decides the combination of assets to be held in the portfolio, quadratic programming quickly calculates the proportions of assets. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on five well-known datasets and compared with other solution approaches in the literature. Obtained results confirm that the proposed solution approach is very efficient especially on the portfolios with low risk and highly competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to outline the problems encountered by a student-managed investment program (SMIP) when the pool of qualified finance majors is limited in number. Restructuring the program to a single-semester course and opening the class to motivated/intelligent non-finance majors increased the number of applicants, but resulted in alternative difficulties, particularly time constraints and inadequate student preparedness. A prerequisite exam and regimented classroom structure were the solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses the problems encountered and solutions devised to address the early year difficulties experienced by a newly developed SMIP at a relatively small university. The core of the paper chronicles the classroom approach to solving the main problem of a single-semester portfolio management course, the handling of an investment learning curve in a short period of time. Findings: Though empirically limited due to the program’s infancy, portfolio performance has been encouraging and student feedback exceptional. Regarding the former, stocks purchased by the fund have created greater wealth in total than that of equal dollar investments in an S&P500 index fund. Practical implications: Universities interested in running a student-managed fund should feel secure in a one-semester approach, regardless of talent pool size, as measured by the number of motivated, intelligent finance majors. Originality/value: Aside from the uniqueness of requiring a mastery of entrance exam investing materials prior to the first class, this paper’s outline of core portfolio management activities includes several strategies and methods meant to streamline the process within a groupthink design. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Traditional and generic portfolio strategies require to forecast the future stocks prices as the model inputs, which is not a trivial task in the real-world applications. To solve the above limitations and provide a better solution for the portfolio management to the inventors, we then develop a portfolio management system (PMS) with equity market neutral strategy in reinforcement learning. A novel reward function involving Sharpe ratio is also designed to evaluate the performance of the developed systems. Experimental results indicate that the PMS with Sharpe ratio reward function has the outstanding performance, and increase the return 39.0% and decrease the drawdown of 13.7% on average than that with reward function of trading return. In addition, the developed PMS-CNN model is more suitable and profitable to construct RL portfolio, but has a 1.98 times more drawdown risk than the PMS-RNN. Overall, the proposed PMS outperforms the benchmark strategies in the measurements of total return and Sharpe ratio. The PMS is profitable and effective with lower investment risk, and the novel reward function by involving Sharpe ratio really enhances the performance, and well support the resource-allocation in the empirical stock trading. © 2020 IEEE.},

The program has been in operation since 2013 and has made significant progress in student placement and connectivity with local, regional and national financial firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors describe the structure, methods used and challenges encountered in this dual portfolio environment and add relevant thoughts for discussion. The authors discuss potential conflicts of interests that may arise in managing a private equity portfolio, the concern of proper deal flow, the issue of the investment timeline when investing in private equity and the problems encountered when measuring private equity performance. Findings: While public asset funds have been around for decades and are relatively well accepted throughout all levels and types of higher education institutions. The uses of private equity funds, though not unheard of, are much less prevalent. Allowing the same group of students to manage both type of portfolios is relatively unique and provides with a more comprehensive learning experience. Originality/value: A primary distinguishing attribute of this program is that accepted students are given the opportunity to simultaneously manage both public and private equity assets throughout an academic year. The goal is to create a comprehensive portfolio management program that replicates a changing investment management environment where private equity is an increasingly significant asset class. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, very few studies have applied sequence models with robust feature engineering to predict future pricing. In this study, we investigate a framework with a set of advanced machine learning forecasting methods with a fixed set of exogenous and endogenous factors to predict daily Bitcoin prices. We study and compare different approaches using the root mean squared error (RMSE).

Many researchers attempted to solve this problem using deep reinforcement learning due to its efficient inherence that can handle the property of financial markets. However, most of them can hardly be applicable to real-world trading since they ignore or extremely simplify the realistic constraints such as transaction costs or slippage. These constraints have a significantly negative impact on portfolio profitability. In this paper a conservative level of transaction fees and slippage are considered for the realistic experiment. To enhance the performance under those constraints, we propose a novel Deterministic Policy Gradient with 2D Relative-attentional Gated Transformer (DPGRGT) model. Applying learnable relative positional embeddings for the time and assets axes, the model better understands the peculiar structure of the financial data in the portfolio optimization domain. Also, gating layers and layer reordering are employed for stable convergence of Transformers in reinforcement learning. In our experiment using U.S. stock market data of 20 years, our model outperformed baseline models and demonstrated its effectiveness. © 2020 IEEE.},

The workflow can be further enhanced to refine signal generation and asset class evolution and definitions. Our results demonstrate that we use this framework in conjunction with resampling methods to optimise component decisions with direct reference to investment objectives while making clear the extent of backtest overfitting. We consider such an online update framework to be a crucial step towards developing intelligent portfolio selection algorithms that integrate financial theory, investor views, and data analysis with process-level learning. © 2020 Investment Analysts Society of South Africa.},

Macroeconomic and market data serve as inputs of Hierarchical Clustering to distinguish among different economic regimes. Compared with traditional models such as Investment Clock, this method can adjust the classification standard in time according to recent market sentiment. The regime, therefore, can be interpreted by not only macro indicators but also investors' mood swings using Artificial Intelligence. When we compute the statistical characteristics of returns of each asset, we find that they can be well distinguished among regimes. This method can also identify the abnormally large wave of the stock market from 2015 to 2016 by separating it as an unusual regime, which cannot be realized by traditional methods. The clustering technique enables us to explain and understand the current market status and predict different assets' performances. Therefore, thanks to the superior interpretability of AI, the mean and variance of returns in each regime are estimated and viewed as viewpoints of the Black-Litterman asset allocation model to construct portfolios. To simulate the real situation, a dynamic backtesting method is used and asset weights change because of the rolling time windows. The results show that equipped with a simple timing strategy, the clustering technique can improve the results and yield excess returns. Some other machine learning techniques are also applied in an attempt to improve the model. © 2020 IEEE.},

This disastrous occurrence propelled portfolio managers to reevaluate and mitigate the risk and return trade-off in building their clients’ portfolios. The advancement of machine-learning algorithms and computing resources helps portfolio managers explore rich information by incorporating macroeconomic conditions into their investment strategies and optimizing their portfolio performance in a timely manner. In this paper, we present a simulation-based approach by fusing a number of macroeconomic factors using Neural Networks (NN) to build an Economic Factor-based Predictive Model (EFPM). Then, we combine it with the Copula-GARCH simulation model and the Mean-Conditional Value at Risk (Mean-CVaR) framework to derive an optimal portfolio comprised of six index funds. Empirical tests on the resulting portfolio are conducted on an out-of-sample dataset utilizing a rolling-horizon approach. Finally, we compare its performance against three benchmark portfolios over a period of almost twelve years (01/2007–11/2019). The results indicate that the proposed EFPM-based asset allocation strategy outperforms the three alternatives on many common metrics, including annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and 99% CVaR. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Portfolio management is a financial problem that has been the subject of much research over the years. It is a planning task where an agent constantly redistributes resources across a set of assets in order to achieve investment objectives and thereby maximize return. However, it remains difficult to obtain an optimal strategy in an environment as complex and dynamic as the financial market. Our article focuses on solving this stochastic control problem in order to obtain an optimal strategy that would allow us to make profitable decisions by interacting directly with the environment. To do this, we explore the power of deep reinforcement learning which differs from traditional Machine Learning by combining the task of predicting stock behavior and analyzing the optimal course of action in a single unit, thus aligning the problem of Machine Learning with the investor's objectives. As a method, we propose to use the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient which is an off-policy algorithm and is used for environments with continuous action spaces. The obtained results demonstrate that the model achieves a higher rate of return than the strategy of 'Uniform Buy and Hold' stocks and the strategy of 'Buy Best Stock in last month'.  © 2021 IEEE.},

In this work, a novel deep Q-learning portfolio management framework is proposed.

This paper proposes a mixed method consisting of long short-term memory networks and mean-variance model for optimal portfolio formation in conjunction with the asset preselection, in which long-term dependences of financial time-series data can be captured. The experiment uses a large volume of sample data from the UK Stock Exchange 100 Index between March 1994 and March 2019. In the first stage, long short-term memory networks are used to forecast the return of assets and select assets with higher potential returns. After comparing the outcomes of the long short-term memory networks against support vector machine, random forest, deep neural networks, and autoregressive integrated moving average model, we discover that long short-term memory networks are appropriate for financial time-series forecasting, to beat the other benchmark models by a very clear margin. In the second stage, based on selected assets with higher returns, the mean-variance model is applied for portfolio optimisation. The validation of this methodology is carried out by comparing the proposed model with the other five baseline strategies, to which the proposed model clearly outperforms others in terms of the cumulative return per year, Sharpe ratio per triennium as well as average return to the risk per month of each triennium. i.e. potential returns and risks. © 2019},

	abstract = {Post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD), one of the most prominent and robust return anomalies, is often attributed to investor naiveté or irrationality. A competing explanation is parameter uncertainty, which posits that PEAD may occur as rational investors encounter parameter uncertainty and must learn about the true values of a firm’s pricing parameters over time. This study extends the parameter uncertainty explanation for PEAD and hypothesizes that industry or market news arriving during the drift period affects drift strength. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that the prices of high surprise firms show stronger responses to industry/market news in the drift period. Hence, the drift becomes stronger (weaker or reversed) when drift-period industry/market news agrees (disagrees) with a firm’s prior earnings news. The evidence helps to distinguish the parameter uncertainty theory from competing behavioral explanations based on investor naiveté or irrational biases, a task previous studies find difficult. Overall, our findings indicate that asset pricing anomalies need not imply investor irrationality—anomalies could arise from rational investors learning about pricing parameters over time. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Drawing on the socio-technical systems theory, we identify seven meta-requirements and specify four principles for the design of an instrument to manage Analytics-as-a-Service (AaaS) portfolios. Our results reinforce the importance of coordinating different socio-technical components in business analytics initiatives and demonstrate how concrete management instruments, such as a proposed portfolio management tool, contribute to socio-technical alignment.

Three different labeling methods, based on financial theory, are defined and assessed. The best results, using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF with character-grams, achieve an increase of 6,3 percentage points above a majority class baseline. These results show that corporate ad-hoc disclosures, which are regulated to represent novel and value-relevant information, are particularly well-suited for this task. Furthermore, the most sophisticated labeling technique used, Jensen's Alpha in the context of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, helps the model achieve its highest accuracy. The results therefore show that financial theory can help isolate the effect of an informational event on stock prices, improving the supervised Machine Learning approach. Finally, an algorithmic trading strategy is simulated with the best model, yielding positive abnormal returns. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The main idea of this article is to approach and compare factor and asset allocation portÂfolios using both traditional and alternative allocation techniques: Inverse variance optimization, minimum-variance optimization, and centrality-based techniques from network science. Analysis of the interconnectedÂness between assets and factors shows that their relaÂtionship is strong. The authors compare the allocation techniques, considering centrality and hierarchal-based networks. They demonstrate the advantages of graph theory to explain the advantages to portfolio manageÂment and the dynamic nature of assets and factors with their "importance score." They find that asset allocaÂtion can be efficiently derived using directed networks, dynamically driven by both US Treasuries and curÂrency returns with significant centrality scores. AlterÂnatively, the inverse variance weight estimation and correlation-based networks generate factor allocation with favorable risk-return parameters. Furthermore, factor allocation is driven mostly by the importance scores of the Fama-French-Carhart factors: SMB, HML, CMA, RMW, and MOM. The authors confirm previous results and argue that both factors and assets are interconnected with different value and momentum factors. Therefore, a blended strategy comprising factors and assets can be defensible for investors. As argued in previous research, factors are much more overcrowded than assets. Therefore, the centrality scores help to identify the crowded expoÂsure and build diversified allocation. The authors run LASSO regressions and show how the network-based allocation can be implemented using machine learning. © 2020 Journal of Portfolio Management. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, a general way of assessing risks and prediction of returns of different types of stocks using various machine learning techniques is reviewed and discussed and compared with the traditional methods. Earlier, more statistical and numerical methods were used for the same purpose. However, the nature of data in financial time series is nonlinear and chaotic. They do not follow linear characteristics, and are often a combination of white noise. To interpret this data meaningfully requires removal of noise and learning only the data that is actually suitable for analysis. Hence machine learning methods are found to be more suitable for applying in the financial domain.

This portfolio framework is proposed with the intent to make it easily accessible conceptually and easily implementable in practice so that it will be of pragmatic value to investment professionals. This imperative of practical feasibility leads to the utilization of standard machine learning techniques that proved effective in overcoming the methodological intricacies associated with mean–variance optimization. Further-more, the author allows for a multiplicity of optimal portfolio outcomes, leaving to the investor some— albeit constrained—discretion in portfolio choice within a class of similarly optimal portfolios. In a Monte Carlo setting that is rich enough to incorporate co-skewness and tail dependencies aside from simple correlation structures between returns, the suggested framework generates more realistic portfolio solutions than mean–variance optimization. © 2020, With intelligence.

Using a rolling-horizon approach, we conduct a series of computational tests with real financial data to evaluate the performance of the machine learning integrated portfolio rebalance framework.

	abstract = {The recent fast development of machine learning provides new tools to solve challenges in many areas. In finance, average options are popular financial products among corporations, institutional investors, and individual investors for risk management and investment because average options have the advantages of cheap prices and their payoffs are not very sensitive to the changes of the underlying asset prices at the maturity date, avoiding the manipulation of asset prices and option prices. The challenge is that pricing arithmetic average options requires traditional numerical methods with the drawbacks of expensive repetitive computations and non-realistic model assumptions. This paper proposes a machine-learning method to price arithmetic and geometric average options accurately and in particular quickly. The method is model-free and it is verified by empirical applications as well as numerical experiments. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Outperforming the markets through active investment strategies is one of the main challenges in finance. The random movements of assets and the unpredictability of catalysts make it hard to perform better than the average market, therefore, in such a competitive environment, methods designed to keep low transaction costs have a significant impact on the obtained wealth. This paper focuses on investing techniques to beat market returns through online portfolio optimization while controlling transaction costs. Such a framework differs from classical approaches as it assumes that the market has an adversarial behavior, which requires frequent portfolio rebalancing. This paper analyses critically the known online learning literature dealing with transaction costs and proposes a novel algorithm, namely Online Gradient Descent with Momentum (OGDM), to control (theoretically and empirically) the costs. The existing algorithms designed for this setting are either (i) not providing theoretical guarantees, (ii) providing a bound to the total regret, conditionally on unrealistic assumptions or (iii) computationally not efficient. In this paper, we prove that OGDM has nice theoretical, empirical, and computational performances. We show that it has regret, considering costs, of the order [EQUATION], T being the investment horizon, and has Θ(M) per-step computational complexity, M being the number of assets. Furthermore, we show that this algorithm provides competitive gains when compared empirically with state-of-the-art online learning algorithms on a real-world dataset.  © 2020 ACM.},

In this paper we present a novel framework for the detection of regime switches within the US financial markets. Principal component analysis is applied for dimensionality reduction and the k-means algorithm is used as a clustering technique. Using a combination of cluster analysis and classification, we identify regimes in financial markets based on publicly available economic data. We display the efficacy of the framework by constructing and assessing the performance of two trading strategies based on detected regimes.  © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {When allocating wealth to a set of financial assets, portfolio optimization techniques are used to select optimal portfolio allocations for given investment goals. Among benchmark portfolios commonly used in modern portfolio theory, the global minimum variance portfolio is becoming increasingly popular with investors due to its relatively good performance which stems from both the low-volatility anomaly and the avoidance of the estimation of first moments i.e. mean returns. However, estimates of minimum variance portfolio weights significantly depend on the size of the rolling window used for estimation, especially considering the non-stationarity of the underlying market dynamics. In this paper, we use a model-free policy-based reinforcement learning framework in order to directly and adaptively determine the optimal size of the rolling window. Training is done on a subset of trading stocks from the NYSE. The resulting agent achieves superior performance when compared against multiple benchmarks, including those with fixed rolling window sizes. © 2020 Croatian Society MIPRO.},

This process is known as the stock selection in portfolio construction. It is about this problem, the paper is designed to address with the help of machine learning task especially one of the supervised learning methods, Artificial Neural Networks. Once this task is accomplished, to find out an efficient portfolio, among a basket of financial portfolios, applied various approaches. One such approach is to compute the minimum variance portfolio subject to the target return. This is the basis of Mean variance theory put forward by Markowitz. Based on this approach the neural network is trained to attain an efficient portfolio. A specific market (India-BSE, NSE) and a particular asset (such as a stock market) are focused. © 2020 IEEE.},

Single-firm event studies are widely used in civil litigation, with billions of dollars in settlements hinging on the outcome of the exercise. We find that regularization (equivalently, penalized estimation) can yield noticeable improvements in both the variance of event-date abnormal returns and significance-test power. Thus we believe that there is a role for ML methods in event studies used in securities litigation. At the same time, we find that ML-induced performance improvements are smaller than those based on other good practices. Most important are (i) the use of a peer index based on returns for firms in similar industries (how this is computed appears to be less important than that some version be included), and (ii) for significance testing, using the SQ test proposed in Gelbach et al.

The authors demonstrate the advantages of graph theory to explain the collective fund dynamics. The results show that equity and bond funds have a significant exposure to the Fama–French–Carhart factors. The authors argue that the network is dynamically driven by equity funds with their centrality scores and risk factor exposure and can transmit and amplify system-wide stress or inefficiencies in the factor bets. Using graph theory, the authors demonstrate that the return-based relationships between bond and equity funds are asymmetrical and the network is sufficiently clustered. Specifically, equity funds connect the different clusters. The HML factor is significant both on a single-fund level and as a web determinant. Therefore, investors should pay close attention to it when managing funds and deriving asset allocations. Finally, the authors provide a machine learning approach to how fund managers, plan sponsors, and analysts can derive equity–bond allocations, based on centrality scores, factor exposure, and hierarchical clustering of asymmetrically connected assets. © 2020, With intelligence.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a scoping literature review, this conceptual paper sets up a common ground for the academic study and industrial development of event portfolio management. Findings: A comprehensive view of event portfolio literature across disciplines reveals its hypostasis as a compound transdisciplinary field. The authors suggest a set of foundational premises whereby they identify 22 principal thematic areas that comprise this emerging field. Practical implications: The establishment of event portfolio management as a distinct field will help in the osmosis and diffusion of new ideas, models and best practices to run and leverage portfolios. The portfolio perspective highlights the need for cohesive learning to design comprehensive systems of events, implement joint strategies, solidify social networks, coordinate multiple stakeholders and develop methods of holistic evaluation. Originality/value: By examining comprehensively event portfolio management as a transdisciplinary field, the authors have been able to identify principal research directions and priorities. This comprehensive analysis provides a synergistic ground, which at this embryonic stage of development, can be used to set out joint trajectories and reciprocal foci across the whole span of scholarship studying planned series of events. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, cryptocurrency has infiltrated almost all financial transactions; thus, it is generally recognized as an alternative method for paying and exchanging currency. Cryptocurrency trade constitutes a constantly increasing financial market and a promising type of profitable investment; however, it is characterized by high volatility and strong fluctuations of prices over time. Therefore, the development of an intelligent forecasting model is considered essential for portfolio optimization and decision making. The main contribution of this research is the combination of three of the most widely employed ensemble learning strategies: ensemble-averaging, bagging and stacking with advanced deep learning models for forecasting major cryptocurrency hourly prices. The proposed ensemble models were evaluated utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models as component learners, which were comprised by combinations of long short-term memory (LSTM), Bi-directional LSTM and convolutional layers. The ensemble models were evaluated on prediction of the cryptocurrency price on the following hour (regression) and also on the prediction if the price on the following hour will increase or decrease with respect to the current price (classification). Additionally, the reliability of each forecasting model and the efficiency of its predictions is evaluated by examining for autocorrelation of the errors. Our detailed experimental analysis indicates that ensemble learning and deep learning can be efficiently beneficial to each other, for developing strong, stable, and reliable forecasting models. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental questions in asset pricing is ‘Why different assets earn different average returns?’ In this paper, we designed an autoencoder based asset pricing model to explain the return difference among the stocks in an index. The trained autoencoder generates a set of latent representations that constitutes a combined -‘communal’- factor to better explains a large portion of the return differences among the stocks in an index. After analyzing all the stocks in S&P-500, Russel-3000, and NASDAQ-100, we found that our proposed latent factor model outperforms many other factor models in predicting the next day's return. Notably, the experiment results show that on average non-communal stocks earn 0.05% over communal stocks. However, the risk associated with this non-communal stock is also 0.8% higher than communal stocks. The experiments confirm that the superior performance comes from the compensation of high risk associated with these non-communal stocks. Investors will benefit from our latent factor model to identify these communal and non-communal stocks for a high return while diversifying their asset portfolio. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study proposes an investment recommendation model for peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. P2P lenders usually are inexpert, so helping them to make the best decision for their investments is vital. In this study, while we aim to compare the performance of different artificial neural network (ANN) models, we evaluate loans from two perspectives: risk and return. The net present value (NPV) is considered as the return variable. To the best of our knowledge, NPV has been used in few studies in the P2P lending context. Considering the advantages of using NPV, we aim to improve decision-making models in this market by the use of NPV and the integration of supervised learning and optimization algorithms that can be considered as one of our contributions. In order to predict NPV, three ANN models are compared concerning mean square error, mean absolute error, and root-mean-square error to find the optimal ANN model. Furthermore, for the risk evaluation, the probability of default of loans is computed using logistic regression. Investors in the P2P lending market can share their assets between different loans, so the procedure of P2P investment is similar to portfolio optimization. In this context, we minimize the risk of a portfolio for a minimum acceptable level of return. To analyse the effectiveness of our proposed model, we compare our decision-making algorithm with the output of a traditional model. The experimental results on a real-world data set show that our model leads to a better investment concerning both risk and return. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization is one of the most important problems in the finance field. The traditional Markowitz mean-variance model is often unrealistic since it relies on the perfect market information. In this work, we propose a two-stage stochastic portfolio optimization model with a comprehensive set of real-world trading constraints to address this issue. Our model incorporates the market uncertainty in terms of future asset price scenarios based on asset return distributions stemming from the real market data. Compared with existing models, our model is more reliable since it encompasses real-world trading constraints and it adopts CVaR as the risk measure. Furthermore, our model is more practical because it could help investors to design their future investment strategies based on their future asset price expectations. In order to solve the proposed stochastic model, we develop a hybrid combinatorial approach, which integrates a hybrid algorithm and a linear programming (LP) solver for the problem with a large number of scenarios. The comparison of the computational results obtained with three different metaheuristic algorithms and with our hybrid approach shows the effectiveness of the latter. The superiority of our model is mainly embedded in solution quality. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of solving complex portfolio optimization problems with tremendous scenarios while maintaining high solution quality in a reasonable amount of time and it has outstanding practical investment implications, such as effective portfolio constructions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Portfolio management is a series of processes that maximize returns and minimize risk by allocating assets efficiently. Along with the developments in machine learning technology, it has been studied to apply machine learning methods to prediction-based portfolio management. However, such methods have a few limitations. First, they do not consider the relations between assets for the prediction. In addition, the studies commonly focus on the prediction accuracy, neglecting the construction of portfolios. Furthermore, the methods have usually been evaluated with index data, which hardly represent actual prices to buy or sell an asset. To overcome these problems, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are employed for base assets for the evaluation, and we propose a two-stage deep learning framework, called Grouped-ETFs Model (GEM), with a joint cost function. The GEM is designed to learn the features of inter-asset and groups in each stage. Also, the proposed joint cost can consider relative returns for the training while the relative returns are a crucial factor to construct a portfolio. The results of a rigorous evaluation with global ETF data indicate that the proposed GEM with the joint cost outperforms the equally weighted portfolio and the ordinary deep learning model by 33.7% and 30.1%, respectively. An additional experiment using sector ETFs verifies the generality of the proposed model where the results accord with those of the previous experiment. © 2019},

	abstract = {Nowadays, Bitcoin has become the most popular cryptocurrency, which gains the attention of investors and speculators alike. Asset pricing is a risky and challenging activity that enchants lots of shareholders. Indeed, the difficulty in making predictions lies in understanding the multiple factors that affect the Bitcoin price trend. Modeling the market behavior and thus, the sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem provides an insight into the predictions of the Bitcoin price. While there are significant studies that investigate the token economics based on the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze the network sentiment on the overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of network sentiments and explore statistical and deep-learning methods to predict Bitcoin future price. In particular, we analyze financial and sentiment features extracted from economic and crowd-sourced data respectively, and we show how the sentiment is the most significant factor in predicting Bitcoin market stocks. Next, we compare two models used for Bitcoin time-series predictions: the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We demonstrate that both models achieve optimal results on new predictions, with a mean squared error lower than 0.14%, due to the inclusion of the studied sentiment feature. Besides, since the ARIMAX achieves better predictions than the RNN, we also prove that, with just a linear model, we may obtain outstanding market forecasts in the Bitcoin scenario. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {At present, cryptocurrencies have become a global phenomenon in financial sectors, as it is one of the most traded financial instruments worldwide. Cryptocurrency is not only one of the most complicated and abstruse fields among financial instruments but also deemed as a perplexing problem in finance due to its high volatility. This work makes an attempt to apply machine learning techniques on the index and constituents of cryptocurrency with a goal to predict and forecast prices thereof. In particular, the purpose of this article is to predict and forecast the close (closing) price of the cryptocurrency index 30 and nine constituents of cryptocurrencies using machine learning algorithms and models so that it becomes easier for people to trade these currencies. We have used several machine learning techniques and algorithms and compared the models with each other to get the best output. We believe that our work will help reduce the challenges and difficulties faced by people who invest in cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the obtained results can play a major role in cryptocurrency portfolio management and in observing the fluctuations in the prices of constituents of cryptocurrency market. We have also compared our approach with similar state of the art works from the literature, where machine learning approaches have been considered for predicting and forecasting the prices of these currencies. In the sequel, we have found that our best approach presents better and competitive results (especially by using ensemble learning method) than the best works from the literature thereby advancing the state of the art. Using such prediction and forecasting methods, people can easily understand the trend and it would be even easier for them to trade in a difficult and challenging financial instrument like cryptocurrency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Recently, the research of reinforcement learning and its application in portfolio optimization is gaining popularity. Within the reinforcement learning framework, an agent can learn a satisfying policy while constructing a portfolio, however, this framework does not work so well with complex dynamical environments and the continuous states due to emotions and lots of unexpected factors in financial markets. To address this issue, we propose a reinforcement learning framework for portfolio optimization based on deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. First, the dynamic portfolio optimization problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with action space, state space, and reward function. Then, a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm is used to learn policies in high dimensional, continuous action space, aiming at controlling the MDP continuously while different optimization policies for portfolios are learned based on different policy networks. Results of the testing on different portfolios consisting of stocks from SP500 demonstrate that learning rate and cash bias are directly related to the activeness of trading strategies while the Average Logarithmic Cumulative Return reward function achieves the best performance among all the suggested reward functions. More importantly, with the help of LSTM layer or full connection layer, the performance of convolution layer is better than other models including all mentioned benchmarks.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of policy optimization in the context of continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL), a branch of artificial intelligence, for financial portfolio management purposes. The underlying asset portfolio process is assumed to possess a continuous-time discrete-state Markov chain structure involving the simplex and ergodicity constraints. The goal of the portfolio problem is the redistribution of a fund into different financial assets. One general assumption has to be set, namely that the market is arbitrage-free (no price arbitrage is possible) then the problem of how to obtain the optimal policy is solvable. We provide a RL solution based on an actor/critic architecture in which the market is characterized by a restriction called transaction cost, involving time penalization. The portfolio problem in Markov chains is determined by solving a convex quadratic minimization problem with linear constraints. Any Markov chain is generated by a stochastic transition matrices and the mathematical expectations of the rewards. In particular, we estimate the elements of the transition rate matrices and the mathematical expectations of the rewards. This method learns the optimal strategy in order to make a decision on what portfolio weight to take for a single period. With this strategy, the agent is able to choose the state with maximum utility and select its respective action. The optimal policy computation is solved employing a proximal optimization novel approach, which involves time penalization in the transaction costs and the rewards. We employ the Lagrange multipliers approach to include the restrictions of the market and those that are imposed by the continuous time frame. Moreover, a specific numerical example in baking, that fit into the general framework of portfolio, validates the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {During risk assessment, exploration geoscientists routinely evaluate various individual risk segments to estimate the chance of success of a given prospect. Usually, this estimation is based on subjectivity, unconscious biases that may lead to inconsistent evaluations. In this research project, the goal is to constrain these biases using cognitive advisors, supported by machine learning algorithms, to overcome the frequent subjectivity and have a fair prospect ranking. This new methodology is based on a new metric - the Level of Knowledge (LoK) - that relies on the available data and geological model to characterize a given prospect. This parameter is anchored to a powerful source of information - the Knowledge Base - a database that structures peer-reviewed inputs and other unstructured information, such as research papers or reports, giving more accurate advices to geoscientists. Overall results show a positive response by testers, which identify the value of having a normalized metric on available knowledge and experience (LoK), as the base for having consistent and fair assessments on their Probability of Success evaluations. As the system is continuously trained, oil and gas companies that integrate this system would benefit of having a consistent portfolio management, thus, supporting exploration strategies. © 81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019.

	abstract = {Investment has an important role in the economic growth of a country. The higher investment value obtained by a country, the faster the country is able to develop their prosperity. However, the investor faces some obstacle in investment activity to have a reasonable return and acceptable risk. In stock investments area, investors could increase chance of getting higher returns by making predictions and diversifying by forming a stock portfolio. Previous studies have stated that Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which are one of the machine learning models inspired by the activity of human brain cells have more advantages to predict the stock future value in terms of speed, accuracy, and the amount of data that can be processed compared to other stock prediction models. Diversification is a method of dividing investment funds into different index stocks, with the aim of reducing the investment risk. With thousands of stocks in the market, deciding which portfolio should be chosen is difficult. This study extends the scope of several previous studies, which are only limited to perform predictions using ANN or GA without forming an optimal stock portfolio. The objective of this study is to predict future stock values using ANN, then form those optimal stock portfolios using GA with aims to get the best optimization of maximal return and minimal risk value. The results of this study show, the implementation of GA as an alternative to the Single Index Model (SIM) method show better optimization index. © 2019 IEEE.},

This side information might include for instance recent stock returns, volatility indexes, financial news indicators, etc. In particular, we demonstrate that a regularized investment policy that linearly combines this side information in a way that is optimal from the perspective of a random sample set is guaranteed to perform also relatively well (i.e., within a perturbing factor of O 1= ffiffiffi pn) with respect to the unknown distribution that generated this sample set. We also demonstrate that these performance guarantees are lost in a high-dimensional regime where the size of the side information vector is of an order that is comparable to the sample size. We further extend these results to the case where non-linear investment policies are considered using a kernel operator and show that with radial basis function kernels the performance guarantees become insensitive to how much side information is used. Finally, we illustrate our findings with a set of numerical experiments involving financial data for the NASDAQ composite index. © 2020 University of Toronto Press Inc.. All rights reserved.},

Most researches focus on macroeconomy perspectives to explain the factors affecting residential asset prices. In this paper we examine some micro factors, like lot area, pool area, that can be used as features to predict house price. We fit a rather simple regression model which contains a few characteristics of a residential asset, and we are able to reach a fairly good result. Some machine learning algorithms such as random forest and support vector machine are also implemented to predict asset pricing. All regression models have a R squared over 0.9. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Agent-based modelling has been proved to be extremely useful for learning about real world societies through the analysis of simulations. Recent agent-based models usually contain a large number of parameters that capture the interactions among microheterogeneous subjects and the multistructure of the complex system. However, this can result in the "curse of dimensionality" phenomenon and decrease the robustness of the model's output. Hence, it is still a great challenge to efficiently calibrate agent-based models to actual data. In this paper, we present a surrogate analysis method for calibration by combining supervised machine-learning and intelligent iterative sampling. Without any prior assumptions regarding the distribution of the parameter space, the proposed method can learn a surrogate model as the approximation of the original system with a relatively small number of training points, which will serve the needs of further sensitivity analysis and parameter calibration research. We take the heterogeneous asset pricing model as an example to evaluate the model's performance using actual Chinese stock market data. The results demonstrate the good capabilities of the surrogate model at modelling the observed reality, as well as the remarkable reduction of the computational time for validating the agent-based model. © 2020 Yi Zhang et al.},

	abstract = {At the early of 21st century, In the UK Peer2Peer (P2P) lending began with Zopa at the start of 2005. After that, it has grown rapidly in United States, China and some other countries. The main challenge for individual investors in the P2P lending market is to allocate their money efficiently through different loans by accurately evaluating the credit of each loan. The traditional ranking models cannot conform to the needs of individual investors in P2P lending because they do not provide natural mechanisms for asset allocation. P2P loans do not have the presence of traditional financial institutions. In this study, we propose a novel method for analyzing data for this emerging market. We have designed a credit risk model based on advanced machine learning methods, capable of assessing the returns and risks of individual loans. We also applied a selection feature method to eliminate the irrelevant features for improving the efficient of machine learning models. We conducted experiments on real-world data sets from P2P lending markets. The experimental results show that the proposed model can improve the efficiency of investment compared to the existing methods of P2P lending. © 2019 Global IT Research Institute (GIRI).},

This research integrated several dimensions of technologies, which contain machine learning, data analytics, and portfolio optimization. We focused on developing robo-advisor framework and utilized algorithms by integrating machine learning and deep learning approaches with the portfolio optimization algorithm by using our predicted trends and results to replace the historical data and investor views. We eliminate the extreme fluctuation to maintain our trading within the acceptable risk coefficient. Accordingly, we can minimize the investment risk and reach a relatively stable return. We compared different algorithms and found that the F1 score of the model prediction significantly affects the result of the optimized portfolio. We used our deep learning model with the highest winning rate and leveraged the prediction result with the portfolio optimization algorithm to reach 12% of annual return, which outperform our benchmark index 0050.TW and the optimized portfolio with the integration of historical data. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Portfolio management (PM) is a fundamental financial planning task that aims to achieve investment goals such as maximal profits or minimal risks. Its decision process involves continuous derivation of valuable information from various data sources and sequential decision optimization, which is a prospective research direction for reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we propose SARL, a novel State-Augmented RL framework for PM. Our framework aims to address two unique challenges in financial PM: (1) data heterogeneity – the collected information for each asset is usually diverse, noisy and imbalanced (e.g., news articles); and (2) environment uncertainty – the financial market is versatile and non-stationary. To incorporate heterogeneous data and enhance robustness against environment uncertainty, our SARL augments the asset information with their price movement prediction as additional states, where the prediction can be solely based on financial data (e.g., asset prices) or derived from alternative sources such as news. Experiments on two real-world datasets, (i) Bitcoin market and (ii) HighTech stock market with 7-year Reuters news articles, validate the effectiveness of SARL over existing PM approaches, both in terms of accumulated profits and risk-adjusted profits. Moreover, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the importance of our proposed state augmentation, providing new insights and boosting performance significantly over standard RL-based PM method and other baselines.

However, machine trading is not confined only these two algorithms, but also time series models. In this study, we will employ time series models namely Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Holt-Winters' Exponential Smoothing (HW) as the guidance for trading since time series models only require time series as an input. We will perform time series analysis to snatch the trading opportunity in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). There are fifty companies on the list of SET50 index; we will choose five amongst them to invest measured by Sharpe Ratio; the top five from this measurement will be selected as invested assets in simulated portfolio. Furthermore, the well-known portfolio optimization framework by Harry Markowitz will be used to ensure that the combination of the invested assets is located on the efficient frontier; the result from this study is favorable as the return generated by these activities outperforms market return; furthermore, manipulating time series into different time lags yields higher return and as well as combining both ARIMA and HW models to help predict stock prices also improves power of prediction of time series models.

Sometimes, it is not easy to track and measure accurately some state variables, and it may be more effective to make decisions based on imprecise information. This paper is focused on the design of an observer (which is unknown) for a class of ergodic homogeneous finite Markov chains with partially observable states. The main goal of the proposed method is the derivation of formulas for computing an observer, and as a result, on optimal control policy. For solving the problem, we introduce a new variable, which involves the product of the policy, the observation kernel and the distribution vector. We derive the formulas to recover the variables of interest. This work considers a dynamic environment for learning the parameters of the POMDP model. The construction of the adaptive policies is based on an identification approach, where we estimate the elements of the transition matrices and utility matrices by counting the number of unobserved experiences. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the practical implications of the theoretical issues applied to a portfolio optimization problem. These findings are important and new to the literature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Most existing deep learning methods focus on proposing an optimal model or network architecture by maximizing return. However, these models often fail to consider and adapt to the continuously changing market conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Agent reinforcement learning-based Portfolio management System (MAPS). MAPS is a cooperative system in which each agent is an independent”investor” creating its own portfolio. In the training procedure, each agent is guided to act as diversely as possible while maximizing its own return with a carefully designed loss function. As a result, MAPS as a system ends up with a diversified portfolio. Experiment results with 12 years of US market data show that MAPS outperforms most of the baselines in terms of Sharpe ratio. Furthermore, our results show that adding more agents to our system would allow us to get a higher Sharpe ratio by lowering risk with a more diversified portfolio. © 2020 Inst. Sci. inf., Univ.

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization is a hot research topic, which has attracted many researchers in recent decades. Better portfolio optimization model can help investors earn more stable profits. This paper uses three deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e., deep multilayer perceptron (DMLP), long short memory (LSTM) neural network and convolutional neural network (CNN) to build prediction-based portfolio optimization models which own the advantages of both deep learning technology and modern portfolio theory. These models first use DNNs to predict each stock's future return. Then, predictive errors of DNNs are applied to measure the risk of each stock. Next, the portfolio optimization models are built by integrating the predictive returns and semi-absolute deviation of predictive errors. These models are compared with three equal weighted portfolios, where their stocks are selected by DMLP, LSTM neural network and CNN respectively. Also, two prediction-based portfolio models built with support vector regression are used as benchmarks. This paper applies component stocks of China securities 100 index in Chinese stock market as experimental data. Experimental results present that the prediction-based portfolio model based on DMLP performs the best among these models under different desired portfolio returns, and high desired portfolio return can further improve the performance of this model. This paper presents the promising performance of DNNs in building prediction-based portfolio models. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Financial portfolio management is the process of periodically reallocating a fund into different financial investment products, with the goal of achieving the maximum profits. While conventional financial machine learning methods try to predict the price trends, reinforcement learning based portfolio management methods makes trading decisions according to the price changes directly. However, existing reinforcement learning based methods are limited in extracting the price change information at single-scale level, which makes their performance still not satisfactory. In this paper, inspired by the Inception network that has achieved great success in computer vision and can extract multi-scale features simultaneously, we propose a novel Ensemble of Identical Independent Inception (EI3) convolutional neural network, with the objective of addressing the limitation of existing reinforcement learning based portfolio management methods. With EI3, multiple assets can be processed independently while sharing the same network parameters. Moreover, price movement information for each product can be extracted at multiple scales via wide network and then aggregated to make trading decision. Based on EI3, we further propose a recurrent reinforcement learning framework to provide a deep machine learning solution for the portfolio management problem. Comprehensive experiments on the cryptocurrency datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing competitors, in both upswing and downswing environments. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

However, the construction industry hasn’t put in much effort in using big data. This paper investigates past and current studies on big data analytics to identify the future technology for the construction industry. The research trend within the industry is examined for prediction and proposal of future opportunities. The study is conducted in stages as described below. First, this study investigates the implementation cases. After that, we determine the past and current research trends. Finally, this study analysis current trends and future directions of big data implementation.There is room for research in construction economics and market, business development, and portfolio management. Research activities in non-construction areas such as biology, management, and social science are the same level as the construction industry. As the proposed model for construction projects was generated based valid research activities, a big data analytics model can be used for implementing big data projects. Thismodel is to divide construction data into project-specific (common) data and industry-specific (spatial) data. The model categorizes a variety of data contents based on characteristics of the data, either project specific data or industry-specific data. The data are then grouped by data analysis methods such as statistics, data mining, or machine learning methods. Finally, the data are grouped by the nature of data, either common information or regional information. The benefit of this approach is to assure the success of big data implementation projects by reconciling project information and industry information together since the success of a big data implementation relies on the integrationof both data.Using this study, realistic resource planning and allocation for future can be projected in advance. Moreover, dynamic property of this model can provide to construction companies with real-time industry and project data. © BEIESP.},

To understand the motivation of those communities, this work improves two existing open source models with a Pareto Optimization and two objectives: costs and carbon emissions. Clustering algorithms support the improvement of the models' scalability and performance. The methods developed in this work gives stakeholders the tool to calculate the capabilities and restrictions of the local energy system. The models are applied to a case study using data from an Austrian city, Linz. Four scenarios help to understand aspects of the energy community, such as the lock-in effect of existing infrastructure and future developments. The results show that it is possible to reduce both objectives, but the solutions for minimum costs and minimum carbon emissions are contrary to each other. This work quantifies the highest effect of emission reduction by the electrification of the system. It may be concluded, that a steady transformation of the local energy systems is necessary to reach economically sustainable goals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: The study systematically investigates persistence in performance for simulated trading among non-professional traders in the futures market. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors employ a novel data set from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group's Trading Challenges for years 2014 through 2018 and expand upon the empirical methodology of Malkiel (1995) through improved interval estimations in testing for persistence in performance. The authors implement Fama-MacBeth style regressions to understand the degree of persistence in performance and the extent to which non-professionals extrapolate from prior returns. They adjust returns for risk through the Fama and French (2015) five-factor model in understanding whether the sample of non-professionals is able to produce excess returns after expenses and whether there is evidence of excess gross to cover expenses. Findings: The empirical analysis suggests strong evidence for performance persistence among non-professionals participating in the Preliminary Rounds. In the Championship Rounds, the authors find that the persistence effect becomes stronger in economic and statistical significance after accounting for expenses. The results suggest that competition and transaction costs help to distinguish between winners and losers. When conducting Fama-MacBeth style regressions, the authors present evidence that strongly supports the persistence effect and over-extrapolation. While the results of the multi-factor model analysis suggest that, after adjusting for risk, most teams are experiencing negative excess returns prior to expenses, the authors also uncover evidence of teams earning returns sufficient to cover their expenses. Originality/value: The authors bridge the gap between the literature on performance persistence and the emerging literature on non-professionals in the financial markets. Data from the CME Group’s Trading Challenge provide a rich source in studying the beliefs of non-professionals, and this study is helpful for understanding how beliefs, operationalized in simulated trades, perform over short time horizons, thereby providing insights into the behavioral dynamics of the financial markets. The results provide new empirical evidence for performance persistence among non-professionals. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Despite its wide acceptance and applicability, it suffers from few limitations. This paper addresses two issues of MV framework: (i) estimation errors of mean-variance model, and (ii) instability of covariance matrix. Risk parity models, robust statistics and robust optimization minimize the effects of estimation errors of parameters of MV framework. The paper presents two such risk parity models for portfolio optimization, namely, (a) Hierarchical Risk Parity model based on Historical correlation (HRP-HC), and (b) Hierarchical Risk parity model based on Gerber statistics (HRP-GS). The models are tested and analysed using stocks comprising the TSX complete index for a time period of 10 years ranging from 2007 to 2016. Results suggest that the proposed HRP-GS model outperforms HRP-HC model. This is due to the fact that the HRP-GS model integrates the advantages of a risk parity model (i.e. HRP) and robust statistics (i.e. Gerber statistics). © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Production optimization for mature hydrocarbon fields face several challenging tasks, including the long process of decision making when inactive and low performing wells are being evaluated. The lack of necessary data integration and evaluation of valuable strings, wells, reservoirs can vary between departments making it challenging to bring a prompt and standardized solution. Therefore, an automated decision-making system has been developed with an open source software with capturing the logics and innovations of subject matter experts and managers. The current assessment is focusing on the automated re-evaluation of inactive strings, low performance wells as well as interventions candidates. Automation process initially starts with proper data analysis and integration. The advisory system consists of unique, fully automated workflows consuming several data sources. Essential part of data integration is to find the most relevant input parameters, which can be used by the optimization system, and provide recommendations to the end user. A hierarchical control system is added in parallel to data import, providing a long-term and easily sustainable data set for evaluation of wells, reservoirs and fields. This approach leads to a long-term and easily sustainable solution platform, which can be updated and extended whenever new resources are available. A scoring system is provided encountering the historcal and current performance of the existing entities like equipment, wells and reservoir including problems faced during operations. Individual well performance (including down-time, losses, status) is assessed by identifying contributing factors of production decline and failures using data-driven machine learning and fundamental analytic models. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

Based on the available literature, numerous methods and heuristics were proposed for solving it and in this paper, a modified moth search algorithm for solving the portfolio selection task is introduced. The moth search algorithm is one of the most recent metaheuristics from the group of swarm intelligence algorithms. Since the portfolio optimization deals with simultaneous optimization of multiple conflicting objectives, modified moth search algorithm was adjusted for handling multi-objective optimization problems. Quality of the proposed algorithm was tested on the standard benchmark problems for portfolio optimization from the OR-library and comparison of the results obtained by the proposed method and the other methods from the literature proposed for the same model and data set was performed. According to these initial experiments, we conclude that the modified moth search algorithm can be successfully applied to this kind of problems. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The task included the calculation of the company's optimal insurance portfolio with the aim of receiving a maximum income from the developed insurance products realization. The game model enables to define the percentage ratio of the providing of the insurance services at the insurance business, considering the conditions of the insurance market and behavior of competitors.

While these techniques, such as Deep Belief Networks or Random Forests, are becoming more and more popular on the market, the academic literature is relatively sparse. Through a series of applications involving hundreds of variables/predictors and stocks, this article presents some of the state-of-the-art techniques and how they can be implemented to manage a long-short portfolio. Numerous practical and empirical issues are developed. One of the main questions beyond big data use is the value of information. Does an increase in the number of predictors improve the portfolio performance? Which features are the most important? A large number of predictors means, potentially, a high level of noise. How do the algorithms manage this? This article develops an application using a 22-year trading period, up to 300 U.S. large caps and around 600 predictors. The empirical results underline the ability of these techniques to generate useful trading signals for portfolios with important turnovers and short holding periods (one or five days). Positive excess returns are reported between 1993 and 2008. They are strongly reduced after accounting for transaction costs and traditional risk factors. When these machine learning tools were readily available in the market, excess returns turned into the negative in most recent times. Results also show that adding features is far from being a guarantee to boost the alpha of the portfolio. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Persistence risk is an endogenous source of risk that arises when a rational agent learns about the length of business cycles. Persistence risk is positive during recessions and negative during expansions. This asymmetry, which solely results from learning about persistence, causes expected returns, return volatility, and the price of risk to rise during recessions. Persistence risk predicts future excess returns, particularly at 3- to 7-year horizons. Its predictability is strongest around business-cycle peaks and troughs. We confirm the model's predictions in the data and provide evidence that persistence risk is priced in financial markets.

	abstract = {There is a seemingly infinite number of ways to partition the investment universe into asset categories. Too fine a partition can lead to very small allocations to certain categories in asset allocation models. When populating those categories with actual strategies, costs increase because due diligence and reporting are not costless activities. The right number of asset categories for building allocations should depend on balancing the marginal benefits and marginal costs of a finer partitioning of the investment universe. In this article, the authors use different machine learning techniques to help quantify these trade-offs. Two unsupervised learning techniques—exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis—are used to identify asset classes. A supervised learning technique—a regression tree—then is used to identify the most important basis for US equities, a specific asset class identified by the unsupervised learning techniques. © 2019, With intelligence.

The Kelly criterion is a theoretical approach of money management, and is a mathematical method for optimizing long-term expected return. Kelly criterion requires the future outcomes distribution as input, which can be predicted through the techniques of machine learning (ML). With the revolutionary growth of the amount of information, big data is the key to boost ML prediction, therefore, we introduce a general Kelly framework, including the strength of Kelly, ML, and big data.In addition, we propose the Kelly stationary index (KSI) to quantity the stationarity of the stock's outcomes distribution, which will affect the trading period and forecasting frequency. We calculate the KSI of each constituent stock of Taiwan's 50, and apply the Kelly criterion strategy to verify the effectiveness of KSI. The experimental results show that there is a moderate downhill relationship between the strategy performance and KSI with the -0.591 of correlation coefficient. It also indicates that the closer the estimated distribution is to the actual distribution, the higher the expected profit. In the future, we will use KSI for money management, strategy development, and apply KSI into the general Kelly framework. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In quantitative trading, stock prediction plays an important role in developing an effective trading strategy to achieve a substantial return. Prediction outcomes also are the prerequisites for active portfolio construction and optimization. However, the stock prediction is a challenging task because of the diversified factors involved such as uncertainty and instability. Most of the previous research focuses on analyzing financial historical data based on statistical techniques, which is known as a type of time series analysis with limited achievements. Recently, deep learning techniques, specifically recurrent neural network (RNN), has been designed to work with sequence prediction. In this paper, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is a special kind of RNN, is proposed to predict stock movement based on historical data. In order to construct an efficient portfolio, multiple portfolio optimization techniques, including equal-weighted modeling (EQ), simulation modeling Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and optimization modeling mean variant optimization (MVO), are used to improve the portfolio performance. The results showed that our proposed LSTM prediction model works efficiently by obtaining high accuracy from stock prediction. The constructed portfolios based on the LSTM prediction model outperformed other constructed portfolios-based prediction models such as linear regression and support vector machine. In addition, optimization techniques showed a significant improvement in the return and Sharpe ratio of the constructed portfolios. Furthermore, our constructed portfolios beat the benchmark Standard and Poor 500 (S&P 500) index in both active returns and Sharpe ratios. © 2020 by the authors.},

In old school quantitative investing, portfolio allocation decisions are typically based on a well-defined investment strategy. Financial portfolio managers devise and apply investment strategies to maximize expected returns for customers’ portfolios. The introduction of AI-enhanced algorithms enables smart machines to automatically revise and update investment strategies, learning from the past. AI itself might produce significant effects on the gains and losses of the portfolio management strategies, raising ethical dilemmas connected with human versus machine responsibility, accountability, and risk. From the managerial point of view, a new dimension of performance measuring, competence evaluation and incentive allocation is required for managing AI software developers in this area. To explore such dilemmas, empirical evidence is drawn here from MDOTM, an innovative and successful young enterprise developing AI-driven investment strategies for financial markets. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

A large body of literature is available on the decision making in IPM. In this study, we analyzed within IPM the cancellation of ideas and projects by gatekeeping boards as well as the possibilities of applying machine learning. The hypotheses were tested with data from three large European telecommunication organizations. In total the three organizations shared 9,118 canceled ideas and projects of which 0.3% was canceled in the gatekeeping boards. 2.7% of the 1,469 gate requests on the agenda of these boards were canceled. The dataset of one organization was used to train four machine learning models to predict the likelihood of idea and project cancellation. The first model is trained to predict the ideas that will be canceled before the first gate approval, the second model does the same for projects being canceled after the first gate is approved but before the second gate is approved. Models three and four are trained for projects in a later phase. The fourth model predicts the cancellation of projects that hold a go on implementation approval. All four hold a high area under the curve of at least 0.802 turning them into possibly valuable instruments for predicting project cancellation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization and quantitative risk management have been extensively studied since the 1990s, and attracted even more attention after the financial crisis in 2008. Such a disastrous event required portfolio managers to better manage the risk and return trade-off when building their clients' portfolios. With that said, the advancement of machine-learning algorithms and computing resources helps portfolio managers explore rich information by incorporating the macro-economy conditions into their investment strategies and optimizing their portfolio performance in a timely manner. In this paper, we present a simulation-based approach by fusing eleven macroeconomic factors using Neural Networks (NN) to build an Economic Factor-based Predictive Model (EFPM). Then, we combine it with Copula-GARCH simulation model and the Mean-Conditional Value at Risk (Mean-CVaR) framework to derive an optimal portfolio comprised of six index funds. Empirical test on the achieved portfolio is conducted on an out-of-sample dataset utilizing a rolling-horizon approach. Finally, we compare its performance against the three benchmark portfolios over a twelve-year period (01/2007-12/2018). The results indicate that the proposed EFPM-based asset allocation strategy outperforms the three alternatives on many common metrics, including annualized return, 99% VaR, and Sharpe ratio. © 2019 ISIF-International Society of Information Fusion.},

	abstract = {In unconventional reservoirs, not only do we have to concern ourselves with having a sufficient hydrocarbon volume to justify development (Resource Fairway), but also whether producibility characteristics, especially the ability   to effectively fracture stimulate, are favorable (commercially). While volumetric characteristics tend to be regionally variable resulting in changes in hydrocarbon fluid types, reservoir pressures, thickness, porosity, saturation,  etc.,  at the basin scale, producibility characteristics tend to be more locally variable resulting in changes in natural fracturing, subsurface stresses, permeability, effectiveness of fracture stimulation barriers, etc., at the field  scale. A  stochastic approach encompasses both these trend variations (regional and local) while assessing the commerciality of the play. This paper will explain the workflow involved in creating a probabilistic model using a commercial  tool for  engineers to understand the mechanics of the model, quality-check the input distributions, compare the model results to those from other sources (such as empirical, analytical, or numerical models). This workflow also will help  in  seamlessly modifying the input parameters to generate "what-if" scenarios and stress test the base case of development projects. Due to the capital-intensive nature of Unconventional projects, it is important to economically model a   series of staged-investments. The purpose of the staging is to responsibly expose incremental capital and identify course corrections. Several factors and combination of inputs affect the commerciality of unconventional developments.   These inputs will then be sampled using Monte Carlo simulation to generate a multitude of trials and their summary statistics. The recoverable resources, costs, and economics can also be exported for any given trial, and the ranges of   input parameters sampled to generate a given trial can also be extracted Five critical parameters and their ranges were identified for developing a stochastic Before Tax (BTAX) economic output reflecting the full range of outcomes. Well   type curves and select components of Capex and Opex were identified as the primary drivers. Associated products, such as condensate, NGLs, ethane, sulfur and water, were modeled as a function of the primary product using dependent   ratios. Variability in cycle time was added to account for delays in implementation and acceleration as learnings are applied. This paper will present how technological integration between legacy in-house developed tools and stochastic   analysis engines, as the centerpiece, can provide management the required level of visibility on project economics and evaluation ranges. With the considerable time spared in carrying out economic assessments due to this workflow,   engineers are able to spend more time in developing case scenarios, run sensitivities, and analyze outcomes and results to make informed portfolio management decisions.

	abstract = {We find equilibrium stock prices and interest rates in a representative-agent model where dividend growth is uncertain, but gradually revealed by dividends themselves, while asset prices reflect current information and the potential impact of future knowledge. In addition to the usual premium for risk, stock returns include a learning premium, which reflects the expected change in prices from new information. In the long run, the learning premium vanishes, as prices and interest rates converge to their counterparts in the standard setting with known dividend growth. If both relative risk aversion and elasticity of intertemporal substitution are above one, the model reproduces the increase in price-dividend ratios observed in the past century, and implies that—in the long run—price-dividend ratios may increase a further forty percent above current levels. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Consider the additional complexity in estimating the cost of equity, contrasting the perspective of a local, non-diversified investor with that of a multinational company operating in 39 countries. Case overview/synopsis: The Chief Financial Officer of a business group has to determine the correct discount rate for an investment in a new hotel in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The group has traditionally used the same discount rate for all projects and is now presented with several alternatives by his team. Estimating the correct country risk adjustment for the project is an important challenge. He knows that there is no clear solution to this challenge that is accepted by all practitioners and academics, but he has to present a recommendation to the board. Complexity academic level: The case study is designed for corporate finance, appraisal or international finance courses in both MBA and executive training programs. To discuss this case study, students are assumed to have been already exposed to the weighted average cost of capital and the CAPM.

	abstract = {A data-driven Neural Network (NN) optimization framework is proposed to determine optimal asset allocation during the accumulation phase of a defined contribution pension scheme. In contrast to parametric model based solutions computed by a partial differential equation approach, the proposed computational framework can scale to high dimensional multi-asset problems. More importantly, the proposed approach can determine the optimal NN control directly from market returns, without assuming a particular parametric model for the return process. We validate the proposed NN learning solution by comparing the NN control to the optimal control determined by solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The HJB equation solution is based on a double exponential jump model calibrated to the historical market data. The NN control achieves nearly optimal performance. An alternative data-driven approach (without the need of a parametric model) is based on using the historic bootstrap resampling data sets. Robustness is checked by training with a blocksize different from the test data. In both two and three asset cases, we compare performance of the NN controls directly learned from the market return sample paths and demonstrate that they always significantly outperform constant proportion strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

The competition between forecasters implies that the impact of their forecasts on realized market prices evolves endogenously. We investigate how these endogenous impacts affect price dispersion and mispricing relative to the fundamental price. Our results show that the effect of endogenous impacts depends on (i) the type of market dynamics (stable/unstable) and (ii) the sensitivity of impacts with respect to forecast accuracy (low/high). Compared to the baseline treatment, where impacts are constant and independent of forecast accuracy, price dispersion and mispricing is somewhat lower in stable markets when impacts are moderately sensitive to forecast accuracy. In contrast, impacts that are strongly sensitive to forecast accuracy can further destabilize unstable markets, amplifying price dispersion and mispricing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Objectives/Scope: A system providing a standardized and automated approach to rapidly screen and rank large well count assets (hundreds or thousands of wells) in a fraction of the time and repeatably, is proposed. The solution enables the proactive management of existing wells by keeping the production enhancement opportunity pipeline full and expediting potential candidates through the Opportunity maturation process (OMP) in an integrated and collaborative framework. Methods, Procedures, Process: The solution is based on a hybrid and automated decision-support system anchored in a knowledge-based framework. Hybrid refers to the integration of (1) petroleum engineering analysis methods and best practices with (2) advanced machine learning algorithms for autonomous well performance signature identification, and (3) the operator's business logic driving the economics of the field. Automated alludes to a continuous running workflow requiring minimal interaction, utilizing machine learning approaches such as neural networks, bayesian belief network models, logistic regressions, advanced optimization, etc. Results, Observations, Conclusions: The application of the proposed solution led to workover and intervention candidate evaluations now routinely performed on a weekly basis (compared to the previous biyearly approval review and approval process across almost 200 well completions, with engineers confirming and validating the system-generated opportunities before escalating them for approval. Moreover, in its early evaluation, the new system has provided 89% in time savings in both the identification and review of intervention candidates and 88% in cost savings resulting from the elimination of manually tedious and routine work. Novel/Additive Information: Asset teams are entrusted with proposing enough well production opportunities on a regular basis. The identification of potential workover candidates remains a manual, tedious and repetitive process consuming several weeks of engineers' time in every iteration. With the addition of the proposed solution in the existing body of literature, asset teams can proactively manage opportunities in their fields. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

	abstract = {Faced with rapidly changing technologies, diminishing product life cycles and heightened global competition, product portfolio managers across all industries encounter increasing challenges within portfolio design processes. Aligning the product portfolio with corporate strategies is central to sustain long-term company success. However, regarding volatile environments, this is becoming increasingly challenging. In the last decades, product portfolio decisions were based on subjective experience, but this is no longer sufficient. Nowadays, as portfolio complexity grows constantly, data-based decision support procedures are needed to enable effective decisions in product portfolio management. Regarding the field of portfolio management, only little research has been conducted on the usage of data-based analytical methods. Additionally, the alignment of product portfolios with corporate strategies is still largely unexplored and, in this context, the application of analytical methods has been largely omitted until now. This paper proposes a methodology that uses neural networks with supervised learning to model correlations among product portfolio control parameters and corporate goal indicators. Based on this, reinforcement learning is applied to derive goal-conform recommendations for product portfolio managers. For both supervised and reinforcement learning, the presented methodology includes generic steps for implementation. Moreover, for both machine learning methods, requirements regarding necessary product portfolio data are elaborated. The methodology is validated using a case study. © 2017 The Authors.

Based on reinforcement learning (RL), a well-established machine learning technique, the authors propose a model that is flexible, accurate and very promising for real-world applications. A key strength of the RL approach is that it does not make any assumptions about the form of trading cost. RL learns the minimum variance hedge subject to whatever transaction cost function one provides. All that it needs is a good simulator, in which transaction costs and options prices are simulated accurately. ©  2019 Pageant Media Ltd.},

Learning about persistence generates high and persistent stock return volatility mostly during recessions, but also (to a smaller extent) during economic booms. Disagreement among agents fluctuates and earns a risk premium. A clear risk–return trade-off appears only when conditioning on the sign and magnitude of disagreement.

This paper proposes a new statistical mechanism to predict speculative bubbles by inferring a significant probability of exuberance at least one step ahead of a bubble peak period. Contrary to other approaches, we combine asset pricing modeling and non-stationarity statistical analysis and use both in the context of adaptive learning to build a dynamic model specification. Monte Carlo simulations show that the ex-ante prediction is improved enormously by adding the estimated abnormal returns into the model. In some cases our mechanism predicts 100% of the last bubbles of the sample up to five periods before the peak. Furthermore, the mechanism is able to successfully anticipate the technological bubble observed in the 1990’s by estimating a probability greater than 90%, one month before the bubble peak. Thus, this new mechanism provides an advantage for investors interested in performing a very profitable “bubble surfing” strategy and for market regulators whose responsibility is to maintain market efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

The objective of the algorithm is to propose the allocation to help investors improve their investment process, suggesting the allocation using the information of the groups and the membership degree of each asset to each group. This work is different from the approaches already proposed in the literature, which essentially use hierarchical clustering algorithms, whereas in this proposal we use a fuzzy partitioning method. The membership degree of each asset to the group was used to determine the percentage of asset allocation: The closer to the medoid, the greater its allocation. Experiments were carried out using data from the Brazilian Stock Exchange and the assets eligible to enter into the allocation were those that were part of the Ibovespa index at the time of portfolio rebalancing. The results were compared with other allocation methods and with the Ibovespa index itself. The proposed algorithm illustrates the potential of soft-computing and machine learning techniques in portfolio optimization. © 2019 IEEE.},

To address the latter shortcoming, the authors show how to use random forests, a machine learning algorithm, to produce factor frameworks that improve upon more traditional models in terms of their ability to account for nonlinearities and interaction effects among variables, as well as their higher explanatory power. The authors also demonstrate, by means of a simple example, how combining the random forest algorithm with another machine learning framework known as association rule learning can produce viable trading strategies.

We use a unique dataset—defined contribution plan account data (observations = 18,781), provided by a Korean financial institute (a recording-keeping service provider). Investment risk preference is measured by three variables: share of equity, five-year volatility of selected funds, and share of principal guaranteed products. While controlling for individual characteristics such as gender, employee status, plan duration, wage, accumulated assets, and number of employees, we test the relationship between individuals’ age and investment risk preference in asset allocation. Echoing the results of previous studies, we find that age is significantly related to investment risk preference. Both equity share and volatility have an inverted-U-shaped relationship with age, and the share of principal guaranteed products has a U-shaped curve coinciding with age. Our results indicate that age is associated with increased risk preference due to learning effects and greater financial understanding. However, after reaching a certain point, risk preference decreases because of the need for a secure retirement income. Finally, the estimated coefficients of the interaction effect variables show that some individual groups—executives, high earners, and large asset holders—are more risk-taking than are other same-age groups. © 2019, Korean Securities Association.

In the Financial Mathematics approach we model the asset prices not via the common approaches used in pairs trading such as a high correlation or cointegration, but with the cointelation model in Mahdavi-Damghani (2013) that aims to reconcile both short-term risk and long-term equilibrium. We maximize the overall PL with Financial Mathematics approach that dynamically switches between a mean-variance optimal strategy and a power utility maximizing strategy. We use a stochastic control formulation of the problem of power utility maximization and solve numerically the resulting HJB equation with the Deep Galerkin method introduced in Sirignano and Spiliopoulos (2018). We turn to Machine Learning for the same PL maximization problem and use clustering analysis to devise bands, combined with in-band optimization. Although this approach is model agnostic, results obtained with data simulated from the same cointelation model gives a slight competitive advantage to the ML over the FM methodology1. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

We contrast the behavior of a manager who may invest her personal wealth in a private account to a manager who is either forced to commit her wealth to the fund she manages or not allowed to hold risky assets held by the fund privately. We show that a fund managed by a manager with higher ability does not necessarily achieve higher expected returns but achieves lower idiosyncratic volatility. For a manager with constant ability, restrictions placed on her personal account do not influence her choices in the fund, while for a manager whose ability varies stochastically, they result in higher expected returns and idiosyncratic volatilities. Fund strategies can be nonmonotone both in the manager's commitment level and the ratio of manager to investor wealth. Our results are robust to incomplete information and to competing managers with correlated ability. © 2018 INFORMS.},

The textual and price information were both encoded in the neural network, and it is therefore difficult to apply this approach in situations other than the original framework of the notoriously hard problem of price prediction. In contrast, this paper presents a method to encode the influence of news articles through a vector representation of stocks called a stock embedding. The stock embedding is acquired with a deep learning framework using both news articles and price history. Because the embedding takes the operational form of a vector, it is applicable to other financial problems besides price prediction. As one example application, we show the results of portfolio optimization using Reuters & Bloomberg headlines, producing a capital gain 2.8 times larger than that obtained with a baseline method using only stock price data. This suggests that the proposed stock embedding can leverage textual financial semantics to solve financial prediction problems. © 2020 Association for Computational Linguistics},

The Genetic Algorithms strategy applied to the MACD was carried out in two different validation periods and sought to optimize the parameters that generate the buy-sell signals. The performance between the machine learning-based approach, technical analysis with the MACD and B&H was compared. The results suggest that it is possible to find optimal values of the technical indicator parameters that result in a higher return on investment through Genetic Algorithms, beating the traditional technical analysis and B&H by around 4%.

	abstract = {High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in a number of models from the financial industry, such as in derivative pricing models, credit valuation adjustment models, or portfolio optimization models. The PDEs in such applications are high-dimensional as the dimension corresponds to the number of financial assets in a portfolio. Moreover, such PDEs are often fully nonlinear due to the need to incorporate certain nonlinear phenomena in the model such as default risks, transaction costs, volatility uncertainty (Knightian uncertainty), or trading constraints in the model. Such high-dimensional fully nonlinear PDEs are exceedingly difficult to solve as the computational effort for standard approximation methods grows exponentially with the dimension. In this work, we propose a new method for solving high-dimensional fully nonlinear second-order PDEs. Our method can in particular be used to sample from high-dimensional nonlinear expectations. The method is based on (1) a connection between fully nonlinear second-order PDEs and second-order backward stochastic differential equations (2BSDEs), (2) a merged formulation of the PDE and the 2BSDE problem, (3) a temporal forward discretization of the 2BSDE and a spatial approximation via deep neural nets, and (4) a stochastic gradient descent-type optimization procedure. Numerical results obtained using TensorFlow in Python illustrate the efficiency and the accuracy of the method in the cases of a 100-dimensional Black–Scholes–Barenblatt equation, a 100-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, and a nonlinear expectation of a 100-dimensional G-Brownian motion. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

A large body of literature to-date suggests Support Vector Machines (SVM)as the “best of regression” algorithms for financial data regression. Recent work however found that new deep learning––Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs)outperformed SVM for classification problems. In the present paper we conduct a new unbiased evaluation of these two modelling techniques for regression problems, and we also compare them with a popular regression model - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)model for financial volatility or risk forecasting. Our experiments using financial data show that the LSTM RNNs performed as good as v-SVR for large interval volatility forecasting and both performed much better than GARCH model for two financial indices (S&P 500 and AAPL). The LSTM RNNS deep learning method can learn from big raw data and can be run with many hidden layers and neurons under GPU to achieve a good prediction for long sequence data compared to the support vector regression. The deep learning technique - LSTM RNNs with big data can be used to improve the volatility prediction instead of v-SVR when the v-SVR does not predict well for some financial stocks of a portfolio. This will help investors to win the competition to maximize their profit. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

We propose a deep neural network (DNN) architecture to describe the underlying control process. The DNN consists of K subnetworks, where K is the total number of decision steps. The feedback control function is determined solely by the network parameters. In this way, the multiperiod portfolio optimization problem is linked to a training problem of the DNN, that can be efficiently computed by the standard optimization techniques for network training. We offer a sufficient condition for the algorithm to converge for a general utility function and general asset return dynamics including serially dependent returns. Specifically, under the condition that the global minimum of the DNN training problem is attained, we prove that the algorithm converges with the quadratic utility function when the risky asset returns jointly follow multivariate autoregressive (1) models and/or multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (1,1) models. Numerical examples demonstrate the superior performance of the DNN algorithm in various return dynamics for a high-dimensional portfolio (up to 100 dimensions). © 2020 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Copyright © by SIAM.},

	abstract = {Solving optimization problems with unknown parameters often requires learning a predictive model to predict the values of the unknown parameters and then solving the problem using these values. Recent work has shown that including the optimization problem as a layer in the model training pipeline results in predictions of the unobserved parameters that lead to higher decision quality. Unfortunately, this process comes at a large computational cost because the optimization problem must be solved and differentiated through in each training iteration; furthermore, it may also sometimes fail to improve solution quality due to non-smoothness issues that arise when training through a complex optimization layer. To address these shortcomings, we learn a low-dimensional surrogate model of a large optimization problem by representing the feasible space in terms of meta-variables, each of which is a linear combination of the original variables. By training a low-dimensional surrogate model end-to-end, and jointly with the predictive model, we achieve: i) a large reduction in training and inference time; and ii) improved performance by focusing attention on the more important variables in the optimization and learning in a smoother space. Empirically, we demonstrate these improvements on a non-convex adversary modeling task, a submodular recommendation task and a convex portfolio optimization task. © 2020 Neural information processing systems foundation.

	abstract = {One of the main contributions of Black–Litterman asset allocation modeling is bringing out the idea of updating portfolios relying on the investor views. The incorporation of such views may inject subjectivity to the modeling phase. There is a recent literature on generating the views with financial forecasting methods, which employ either econometric or learning algorithms. In this research, we aim to propose a hybrid approach to the stream, in which GARCH modeling is used for predicting indicators for the stocks, followed by translating the indicator forecasts to return forecasts through Support Vector Regression. The obtained return forecasts are then fed into Black–Litterman modeling as investor views vector in order to generate portfolios with rolling data. The proposed model is tested in two markets: an emerging market (BIST-30 index of Istanbul Stock Exchange) and a developed market (Dow Jones Index of US Stock Market). In general, the results reveal better portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios than the index return for different holding periods, as well as better portfolio returns than randomly generated portfolios. We further show that the indicators can be accounted relying on the state or the market (non-trending or trending). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

It has become an emerging topic for both financial investors and researchers recently. Traditional investment and portfolio theories, which are used for the optimization of financial investment portfolios, are inadequate for decision-making and the construction of an optimized socially responsible investment portfolio. In response to this problem, we introduced a Deep Responsible Investment Portfolio (DRIP) model that contains a Multivariate Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory neural network, to predict stock returns for the construction of a socially responsible investment portfolio. The deep reinforcement learning technique was adapted to retrain neural networks and rebalance the portfolio periodically. Our empirical data revealed that the DRIP framework could achieve competitive financial performance and better social impact compared to traditional portfolio models, sustainable indexes and funds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Vulnerable nature of price forecasts, such as an unpredictability of future and numbers of socio-economic factors that affect market stability, often makes investment risky. Earlier studies in Finance suggested that constructing a portfolio can promise risk-spread gains. While Fund Standardization improved the traditional theories by reducing the computational complexity and by associating every interaction in the portfolio, such a method still cannot become a winning strategy because it does not measure the current value or the relative price of each asset. Inspired by the works of finding returns per risk, we attempt to design an optimal portfolio by searching products that have potential to grow further. More specifically, we first analyze risk-adjusted returns in the previous periods and use their inertia as a momentum. However, because historic movements alone do not fully elucidate future changes nor guarantee positive returns, we scored the relative values of each stock to make more informed estimations. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model, we measured the values of each stock and determined those undervalued. In this study, we applied a Genetic Algorithm to optimize portfolios while incorporating the momentum strategy and the asset valuations. The proposed GA model was tested in two separate markets, SP500 and KOSPI200, and projected greater profits than that from both the previous method with momentum method and the market indexes. From the experimental results, the proposed CAPM+ method was found to be very effective in financial data analysis and to lay a groundwork for a sustainable investment execution. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The world is on the verge of technological revolution, which will fundamentally change the way of life, work and attitude towards each other [1]. We live in the era of the Third Industrial (or Digital) Revolution, but modern world leaders are already actively preparing for a new period-the Fourth Industrial Revolution or Industry 4.0. New forms of interaction open up opportunities in the organization of work and change requirements for employees. Business becomes digital, but the person stays. Employees will continue to remain crucial factors in innovation, continually developing products and services. The lack of talented and skilled personnel will be the main problem of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Flexible production through FIR will require much more skills in all workflows for all employees. Skilled workers will be more in demand in the future for making decisions that can not be replaced by any algorithm. At the same time, employees must be trained and qualified for new jobs, so it is essential to review standards, for example, in education and training, and adapt them to new requirements. The implementation of interactive technologies in learning has become a necessity. One of the effective methods is business games: both independently and in combination with theoretical training. Precisely this combination (practice) is optimal for students to learn lecture material and acquire competencies. The article is devoted to the description of the technique of conducting risk management training. We described the technology of the training, dividing it into two parts. In the first part, the students are reminded of the risk management theory; in the second part, a business game is held-"Investment portfolio". In the article, we showed how it could be carried out with and without the use of gadgets/computers. As an example, we considered the most frequent mistake when conducting this game and gave a correct model. Besides, in the article, we gave formulas for automating the game of Excel. © BEIESP.},

	abstract = {A data-driven approach called CaNN (Calibration Neural Network) is proposed to calibrate financial asset price models using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Determining optimal values of the model parameters is formulated as training hidden neurons within a machine learning framework, based on available financial option prices. The framework consists of two parts: a forward pass in which we train the weights of the ANN off-line, valuing options under many different asset model parameter settings; and a backward pass, in which we evaluate the trained ANN-solver on-line, aiming to find the weights of the neurons in the input layer. The rapid on-line learning of implied volatility by ANNs, in combination with the use of an adapted parallel global optimization method, tackles the computation bottleneck and provides a fast and reliable technique for calibrating model parameters while avoiding, as much as possible, getting stuck in local minima. Numerical experiments confirm that this machine-learning framework can be employed to calibrate parameters of high-dimensional stochastic volatility models efficiently and accurately. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This paper investigates if energy block chain based crypto currencies can help diversify equity portfolios consisting primarily of leading energy companies of the US S&P Composite 1500 energy index. Key contributions are in terms of assessing the importance of energy cryptos as alternative investments in portfolio management, and whether different volatility models such as autoregressive moving average – Generalized Autoregressive Heteroskedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) and machine learning (ML) can help investors make better investment decisions. The methodology utilizes the traditional Markowitz mean-variance framework to obtain optimized portfolio combinations. Volatility measures, derived from the Cornish-Fisher adjusted variance, ARMA family classes and ML models are used to compare efficient portfolios. The study also analyses the effect of adding cryptos to equity portfolios with non-positive excess returns. Different models are assessed using the Sharpe performance measure. Daily data is used, spanning from November 21, 2017 to January 31, 2019. Findings suggest that energy based cryptos do not have a significant impact on energy equity portfolios, despite the use of different risk measures. This is attributable to the relatively poor performance of energy cryptos which did not contribute in improving the excess return per unit of risk of efficient portfolios based on the leading US energy stocks. © 2020, Econjournals.

	abstract = {One of the major challenges in multivariate analysis is the estimation of population covariance matrix from the sample covariance matrix (SCM). Most recent covariance matrix estimators use either shrinkage transformations or asymptotic results from Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Both of these techniques try to achieve a similar goal which is to remove noisy correlations and add structure to SCM to overcome the bias-variance trade-off. Both methods have their respective pros and cons. In this paper, we propose an improved estimator which exploits the advantages of these techniques by taking optimally weighted convex combination of covariance matrices estimated by shrinkage transformation and a filter based on RMT. It is a generalized estimator which can adapt to changing sampling noise conditions by performing hyperparameter optimization. Using data from six of the world's biggest stock exchanges, we show that the proposed estimator outperforms the existing estimators in minimizing the out-of-sample risk of the portfolio and hence predicts population statistics more precisely. The proposed estimator can be useful in a wide range of machine learning and signal processing applications.  © 1994-2012 IEEE.},

In particular, we propose to use a combination of recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) and particle swarm algorithm (PSO) with Calmar ratio for both asset allocation and constraint optimization. Using S&P100 index stocks, we show such a system with a Calmar ratio based objective function yields a better efficient frontier than the Sharpe ratio and mean-variance based portfolios. By comparing with multiple PSO based long only constrained portfolios, we propose an optimal portfolio trading system that is capable of generating both long and short signals and handling the common portfolio constraints. We further develop an adaptive RRL-PSO portfolio rebalancing decision system with a market condition stop-loss retraining mechanism, and we show that the proposed portfolio trading system outperforms the benchmarks consistently especially under high transaction cost conditions. © 2019},

	abstract = {Recently, various machine learning techniques have been applied to solve online portfolio optimization (OLPO) problems. These approaches typically explore aggressive strategies to gain excess returns due to the existence of irrational phenomena in financial markets. However, existing aggressive OLPO strategies rarely consider the downside risk and lack effective trend representation, which leads to poor prediction performance and large investment losses in certain market environments. Besides, prediction with a single model is often unstable and sensitive to the noises and outliers, and the subsequent selection of optimal parameters also become obstacles to accurate estimation. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel kernel-based aggregating learning (KAL) system for OLPO. It includes a two-step price prediction scheme to improve the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. Specifically, a component price estimator is built by exploiting additional indicator information and the nonstationary nature of financial time series, and then an aggregating learning method is presented to combine multiple component estimators following different principles. Next, this paper conducts an enhanced tracking system by introducing a kernel-based increasing factor to maximize the future wealth of next period. At last, an online learning algorithm is designed to solve the system objective, which is suitable for large-scale and time-limited situations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets from diverse real markets show that KAL outperforms other state-of-the-art systems in cumulative wealth and some risk-adjusted metrics. Meanwhile, it can withstand certain transaction costs. © 2020 Xin Wang et al.},

We discuss how standard reinforcement learning methods can be applied to non-linear reward structures, i.e. in our case convex risk measures. As a general contribution to the use of deep learning for stochastic processes, we also show in Section 4 that the set of constrained trading strategies used by our algorithm is large enough to ε-approximate any optimal solution. Our algorithm can be implemented efficiently even in high-dimensional situations using modern machine learning tools. Its structure does not depend on specific market dynamics, and generalizes across hedging instruments including the use of liquid derivatives. Its computational performance is largely invariant in the size of the portfolio as it depends mainly on the number of hedging instruments available. We illustrate our approach by an experiment on the S&P500 index and by showing the effect on hedging under transaction costs in a synthetic market driven by the Heston model, where we outperform the standard ‘complete-market’ solution. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

However, it remains an open question whether DRL can reach human level in applications to financial problems and in particular in detecting pattern crisis and consequently dis-investing. In this paper, we present an innovative DRL framework consisting in two sub-networks fed respectively with portfolio strategies past performances and standard deviations as well as additional contextual features. The second sub network plays an important role as it captures dependencies with common financial indicators features like risk aversion, economic surprise index and correlations between assets that allows taking into account context based information. We compare different network architectures either using layers of convolutions to reduce network's complexity or LSTM block to capture time dependency and whether previous allocations is important in the modeling. We also use adversarial training to make the final model more robust. Results on test set show this approach substantially over-performs traditional portfolio optimization methods like Markovitz and is able to detect and anticipate crisis like the current Covid one. © 2020 IEEE},

	abstract = {In the classic mean-variance portfolio theory as proposed by Harry Markowitz, the weights of the optimized portfolios are directly proportional to the inverse of the asset correlation matrix. However, most contemporary portfolio optimization research focuses on optimizing the correlation matrix itself, and not its inverse. In this article, the author demonstrates that this is a mistake. Specifically, from the Big Data perspective, she proves that the inverse of the correlation matrix is much more unstable and sensitive to random perturbations than is the correlation matrix itself. As such, optimization of the inverse of the correlation matrix adds more value to optimal portfolio selection than does optimization of the correlation matrix. The author further shows the empirical results of portfolio reallocation under different common portfolio composition scenarios. The technique outperforms traditional portfolio allocation techniques out of sample, delivering nearly 400% improvement over the equally weighted allocation over a 20-year investment period on the S&P 500 portfolio with monthly reallocation. In general, the author demonstrates that the correlation inverse optimization proposed in this article significantly outperforms the other core portfolio allocation strategies, such as equally weighted portfolios, vanilla mean-variance optimization, and techniques based on the spectral decomposition of the correlation matrix. The results presented in this article are novel in the data science space, extend far beyond financial data, and are applicable to any data correlation matrixes and their inverses, whether in advertising, healthcare, or genomics. © 2019 Pageant Media Ltd.},

After investors’ initial decisions, for which we confirm previous findings, we do not find persistent differences of simulation-based learning on investors’ risk-taking behavior.

	abstract = {Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence based on the theory that machines can learn from data, discern patterns and make decisions with negligible human intervention. With today's world being inundated by data, machine learning is very relevant due to the amount of learning potential. Machine learning caters to a variety of applications including image recognition, speech recognition, weather prediction, portfolio optimization and so on. The Forex Exchange is a market that allows traders and investors to buy, sell and exchange currencies of various nations. It is regarded as the largest financial market with over 5 trillion American dollars in daily trades, which is larger than the equity and futures markets combined. The Commodity market is a market that allows buying, selling and exchanging of raw materials or primary products. Using the concept of machine learning, this project aims to develop and introduce an agent to automate the trade of a given commodity or currency in a simulated market with the objectives of maximizing returns and minimizing losses for the trader. The model learns from trends in historical market data and is capable of buying, selling or holding a trade at a given instance. The model is validated by running the agent on unseen market data of a later period and the returns generated are analyzed. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Stochastic compositional optimization arises in many important machine learning applications. The objective function is the composition of two expectations of stochastic functions, and is more challenging to optimize than vanilla stochastic optimization problems. In this paper, we investigate the stochastic compositional optimization in the general smooth non-convex setting. We employ a recently developed idea of Stochastic Recursive Gradient Descent to design a novel algorithm named SARAH-Compositional, and prove a sharp Incremental First-order Oracle (IFO) complexity upper bound for stochastic compositional optimization: O((n + m)1/2e-2) in the finite-sum case and O(e-3) in the online case. Such a complexity is known to be the best one among IFO complexity results for non-convex stochastic compositional optimization. Numerical experiments on risk-adverse portfolio management validate the superiority of SARAH-Compositional over a few rival algorithms. © 2019 Neural information processing systems foundation.

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization in stock markets has been investigated by many researchers. It looks for a subset of assets able to maintain a good trade-off control between risk and return. Several algorithms have been proposed to portfolio management. These algorithms use known return and correlation data to build subset of recommended assets. Dynamic stock correlation networks, whose vertices represent stocks and edges represent the correlation between them, can also be used as input by these algorithms. This study proposes the definition of constants of the classical mean-variance analysis using machine learning and weighted link prediction in stock networks (method named as MLink). To assess the performance of MLink, experiments were performed using real data from the Brazilian Stock Exchange. In these experiments, MLink was compared with mean-variance analysis (MVA), a popular method to portfolio optimization. According to the experimental results, using weighted link prediction in stock networks as input considerably increases the performance in portfolio optimization task, resulting in a gross capital increase of 41 % in 84 days. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

These rates are known to be optimal up to logarithmic factor, even without constraints. We conduct numerical experiments on basis pursuit, hard margin support vector machines and portfolio optimization problems and show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art practical performance.

	abstract = {This study investigates the evolution of the design, development and implementation of a strategic sourcing framework able to support decision-makers in formulating differentiated, rather than generic supplier base strategies. These strategies are in turn implemented through specific action plans, assuring the coherence and alignment between the different strategic hierarchical levels, beginning with business strategy, through category strategy to specific tactical sourcing levers. The proposed framework is the result of a longitudinal study executed through two action research cycles engaging in a strategic sourcing project in a leading European specialty steels manufacturer. By integrating and refining in our framework three dominant purchasing portfolio models - i.e. Kraljic, Olsen & Ellram, and Scott & Westbrook - we highlight the importance of adopting multiple perspectives to manage the complexity of formulating a purchasing strategy and its related implementation decisions. The proposed framework has been designed to facilitate dynamic learning mechanisms through a feedback loop to continuously update the three integrated models and in turn allow managers to gain a strategic perspective of the evolution of buyer-supplier relationships, the influence of previous decisions and external factors. A critical discussion explores the proposed solution through the main theoretical lenses emerged throughout the research process. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

However, how market participants’ behavior is affected by public mood has been rarely discussed. Consequently, there has been little progress in leveraging public mood for the asset allocation problem, which is preferred in a trusted and interpretable way. In order to address the issue of incorporating public mood analyzed from social media, we propose to formalize public mood into market views, because market views can be integrated into the modern portfolio theory. In our framework, the optimal market views will maximize returns in each period with a Bayesian asset allocation model. We train two neural models to generate the market views, and benchmark the model performance on other popular asset allocation strategies. Our experimental results suggest that the formalization of market views significantly increases the profitability ($$5\%$$ to $$10\%$$ annually) of the simulated portfolio at a given risk level. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

However, this new wave of research is not limited to computer science or software engineering anymore. Among others, machine learning tools are now used in financial problem settings as well. Therefore, this paper mentions a specific definition of machine learning in an asset pricing context and elaborates on the usefulness of machine learning in this context. Most importantly, the literature review gives the reader a theoretical overview of the most recent academic studies in empirical asset pricing that employ machine learning techniques. Overall, the paper concludes that machine learning can offer benefits for future research. However, researchers should be critical about these methodologies as machine learning has its pitfalls and is relatively new to asset pricing. © 2019, Swiss Society for Financial Market Research.},

With a variety of project management tools available in the market, it is a demanding task to look for a tool appropriate to the needs of the organization. It is an observation by scholars and suggests project management tool users tend to read first the reviews and comments of the product before deciding on the tool they are going to implement. This study facilitates sentiment analysis which can help identify effective and efficient project management tool. Microsoft Office Project is one of the most popular and most reviewed tools for more efficient project and portfolio management. The researchers manually extracted data from various websites containing comments and reviews from different users or reviewers. Machine learning-based-approach using RapidMiner was utilized to analyze the collected data from the web reviews. Sentiment analysis from MS Project reviews was applied using supervised learning K-nearest neighbor (KNN). The first level of classification involved classifying statements as "satisfied" and "dissatisfied." The second level of classification involved clustering sentiments as cost, experience, task, support and interface. Statements classified as satisfied is greater than dissatisfied. The best features to apply when classifying the PM tool reviews dataset are using stopwords, length, stemming and trigram. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of paper books for teaching and learning has many limitations in terms of cost and efficiency. The advantages of digital textbooks are emphasized in many studies. Researchers say that the use of digital textbooks as mediators of the 21st century provides the ability to solve a variety of educational and learning problems for the future. However, many stakeholders in education, such as teachers, students, parents, publishers and educators, are not prepared to accept it and infrastructure is incomplete. In Korea, digital textbooks are used in classrooms in 2018. Publishers are creating new digital textbooks containing sophisticated digital content in accordance with government guidelines, teachers want to create customized lessons for each student level, and profitability and market expectations are changing the importance of digital asset pricing in the textbook market. In this paper, we explore factors that affect digital textbook pricing, to help publishers maximize revenue over their product lifecycle. © 2019, Sciedu Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Forecasting stock returns is an exacting prospect in the context of financial time series. This study proposes a unique decision-making model for day trading investments on the stock market. In this regard, the model was developed using a fusion approach of a classifier based on machine learning, with the support vector machine (SVM) method, and the mean-variance (MV) method for portfolio selection. The model's experimental evaluation was based on assets from the São Paulo Stock Exchange Index (Ibovespa). Monthly rolling windows were used to choose the best-performing parameter sets (the in-sample phase) and testing (the out-of-sample phase). The monthly windows were composed of daily rolling windows, with new training of the classifying algorithm and portfolio optimization. A total of 81 parameter arrangements were formulated. To compare the proposed model's performance, two other models were suggested: (i) SVM + 1/N, which maintained the process of classifying the trends of the assets that reached a certain target of gain and which invested equally in all assets that had positive signals in their classifications, and (ii) Random + MV, which also maintained the selection of those assets with a tendency to reach a certain target of gain, but where the selection was randomly defined. Then, the portfolio's composition was determined using the MV method. Together, the alternative models registered 36 parameter variations. In addition to these two models, the results were also compared with the Ibovespa's performance. The experiments were formulated using historical data for 3716 trading days for the out-of-sample analysis. Simulations were conducted without including transaction costs and also with the inclusion of a proportion of such costs. We specifically analyzed the effect of brokerage costs on buying and selling stocks on the Brazilian market. This study also evaluated the classifier's performance, portfolios’ cardinality, and models’ returns and risks. The proposed main model showed significant results, although demand for trading value can be a limiting factor for its implementation. Nonetheless, this study extends the theoretical application of machine learning and offers a potentially practical approach to anticipating stock prices. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

We propose to design both undirected and directed volatility networks of global stock market based on simple pair-wise correlation and system-wide connectedness of national stock indices using a vector auto-regressive model. We examine the effect and usefulness of network indicators by applying them as inputs for determining strategies via several machine learning approaches (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest). Two strategies are constructed considering stock price indices: (1) global stock market prediction strategy and (2) regional allocation strategy for developed market/emerging market. According to the results of the performance analysis, network indicators were proven to be important supplementary indicators in predicting global stock market and regional relative directions (up/down). In particular, these indicators were more effective during market crisis periods. This study is the first attempt to construct strategies for global portfolio management using financial network indicators and to suggest how network indicators can be used in practical fields. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

A framework is tested using a case study approach involving face-to-face structured interviews. We identified purchasing, refining and sales and marketing as strong candidates to be the core competencies. However, despite the company's core business of refining oil, the core competencies were identified to be their research and development and performance management (PM) capabilities. We further provide a procedure to determine different kinds of physical, intellectual and cultural resources making a dominant impact on company's competence portfolio. In addition, we provide a comprehensive set of guidelines on how to develop core competence further by forging a partnership alliance choosing an appropriate network topology.

	abstract = {Forecasting the stock returns in the emerging markets is challenging due to their peculiar characteristics. These markets exhibit linear as well as nonlinear features and Conventional forecasting methods partially succeed in dealing with the nonlinear nature of stock returns. Contrarily, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a flexible machine learning tool which caters both the linear and nonlinear markets. This paper investigates the forecasting ability of ANN by using Fama and French five-factor model. We construct ANN’s based on the composite factors of the FF5F model to predict portfolio returns in two stages; in stage one, the study identifies the best-fit combination of training, testing, and validation along with the number of neurons full sample period. In stage two, the study uses this best combination to forecast the model under 48-months rolling window analysis. In-sample and out-sample comparisons, regression, and goodness of fit test and actual and predicted values of the stock returns of our ANN model reveal that the proposed model accurately predicts the one-month ahead returns. Our findings reinforce the investment concept that the markets compensate the high-risk portfolios more than mid and low beta portfolios and the methodology will significantly improve the return on investment of the investors. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {                             A risk measure that specifies minimum capital requirements is the amount of cash that must be added to a portfolio to make its risk acceptable to regulators. The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the demise of the most widely used risk measure, Value-at-Risk. Unlike the Conditional VaR model of Rockafellar & Uryasev, VaR ignores the possibility of abnormal returns and is not even a coherent risk measure as defined by Pflug. Both VaR and CVaR portfolio optimizers use asset-price return histories. Our novelty here is introducing an annual Desirability Value (DV) for a company and using the annual differences of DVs in CVaR optimization, instead of simply utilizing annual stock-price returns. The DV of a company is the perpendicular distance from the fundamental position of that company to the best separating hyperplane H                             0                              that separates profitable companies from losers during training. Thus, we introduce both a novel coherent surrogate risk measure, Conditional-Desirability-Value-at-Risk (CDVaR) and a direction along which to reduce (downside) surrogate risk, the perpendicular to H                             0                             . Since it is a surrogate measure, CDVaR optimization does not produce a cash amount as the risk measure. However, the associated CVaR (or VaR) is trivially computable. Our machine-learning-fundamental-analysis-based CDVaR portfolio optimization results are comparable to those of mainstream price-returns-based CVaR optimizers.                          © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

More precisely, we study portfolio optimization under cardinality constraint, which limits the number of assets in a portfolio. This problem is known to be NP-hard and, consequently, difficult to solve for some settings of the cardinality parameter. In order to solve the problem, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines effectively an existing bandit learning algorithm with a kernel search heuristic. The bandit learning algorithm is used for conducting online portfolio selections and the kernel search manages the cardinality constraint. In order to investigate the performance of our algorithm, we carried out computational experiments on real-world market data sets. According to the numerical results, we observe that, despite the presence of cardinality constraint, our hybrid algorithm shows good performance in solving the test instances in reasonable computation time and, in many cases, the algorithm provides portfolios with higher cumulative wealth than those obtained through the existing bandit learning algorithm, which is applied on classical portfolio selection problem. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Buildings are responsible for 30–40% of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption worldwide. Thus, reducing the overall energy use and associated emissions in buildings is crucial for meeting sustainability goals for the future. In recent years, smart energy meters have been deployed to enable monitoring of energy use data with hourly or sub-hourly temporal resolution. The concurrent rise of information technologies and data analytics enabled the development of novel applications such as customer segmentation, load profiling, demand response, energy forecasting and anomaly detection. In this paper, we address load profiling and benchmarking, i.e., determining peer groups for buildings. Traditionally, static characteristics, e.g., primary space use (PSU) together with the annual energy-use-intensity (EUI) have been used to compare the performance of buildings. Data-driven benchmarking approaches have begun to also consider the shape of the load profiles as a means for comparison. In this work, we identify three fundamental load shape profiles that characterize the temporal energy use in any building. We obtain this result by collecting a dataset of unprecedented variety in size (3829 buildings) and primary use (75 programs), and applying a rigorous clustering analysis followed by entropy calculation for each building. The existence of fundamental load shape profiles challenges the man-made, artificial classification of buildings. We demonstrate in a benchmarking application that the resulting data-driven groups are more homogeneous, and therefore more suitable for comparisons between buildings. Our findings have potential implications for portfolio management, building and urban energy simulations, demand response and renewable energy integration in buildings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

For instance, it has been widely used in financial areas such as stock market prediction, portfolio optimization, financial information processing and trade execution strategies. Stock market prediction is one of the most popular and valuable area in finance. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as the discriminator and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as the generator for forecasting the closing price of stocks. The generator is built by LSTM to mine the data distributions of stocks from given data in stock market and generate data in the same distributions, whereas the discriminator designed by MLP aims to discriminate the real stock data and generated data. We choose the daily data on S&P 500 Index and several stocks in a wide range of trading days and try to predict the daily closing price. Experimental results show that our novel GAN can get a promising performance in the closing price prediction on the real data compared with other models in machine learning and deep learning. © 2019 The Author(s).},

They apply their approach to test the assumption that the CAPM is a well-diversified portfolio model by using data from the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The results from the ML-CAPM validate both market indexes as well diversified, with statistically insignificant variation in unsystematic risks during and after the 2007 financial crisis. Furthermore, the ML-CAPM provides smaller root mean square error and mean absolute deviations compared to the traditional CAPM. ©  2019 Pageant Media Ltd.},

	abstract = {Online portfolio selection is one of the most important problems in several research communities, including finance, engineering, statistics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, etc. The primary aim of online portfolio selection is to determine portfolio weights in every investment period (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly etc.) to maximize the investor's final wealth after the end of investment period (e.g., 1 year or longer). In this paper, we present an efficient online portfolio selection strategy that employs a heuristic artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to maximise the total wealth based on historical stock prices. Based on empirical studies conducted on recent historical datasets for the period 2000 to 2017 on four different stock markets (i.e., NYSE, S & P500, DJIA, and TSX), the proposed algorithm has been shown to outperform both Anticor and OLMAR -the two most prominent portfolio selection strategies in contemporary literature. The algorithm achieved 34.22 of the total wealth while Anticor and OLMAR returned 1.08, and 4.52 respectively, on the NYSE market. On the S & P market, the algorithm returned 15.39 of the total wealth while the Anticor and OLMAR returned 6.20 and 2.2, respectively. On the TSX market, the algorithm returned 2.43 of the total wealth while Anticor and Olmar returned 0.96 and 0.41, respectively. © 2019 International Academic Press.},

To this end, we propose an integrated loan evaluation model that exploits and fuses multi-source information from both the borrower and the investor for improving investment decisions in P2P lending. First, based on the borrower's credit, we build a kernel-based credit risk model to quantitatively evaluate each loan. Second, we build an investor composition model that exploits information from the investor's investment behavior for loan evaluation. Then, based on the above two quantitative models and correlation, we define a multi-kernel weight and develop an integrated loan assessment model that can evaluate a loan with both the return and risk. Furthermore, based on the integrated information loan evaluation model, we formalize the investment decisions in P2P lending as a portfolio optimization problem with boundary constraints to help investor make better investment decisions. To validate the proposed model, we perform extensive experiments on the real-world data from the world's largest P2P lending marketplace. Experimental results reveal that the integrated loan evaluation model can significantly enhance investment performance beyond the existing model in P2P market and other baseline models. © 2019 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

	abstract = {Since the inception of asset pricing models, starting as far back as beginning of XX century, and moreover after the fundamental work of Black and Scholes (1973), there has been considerable interest in analytical research of stock exchange equities behavior. Still up to nowadays it remains a critical task for participants engaged in the field of “financial mathematics”. The reason of such an undying interest is that to adequately assess investments risks the stock exchange actors (brokers, investors, traders, et. al) need still more and more accurate prediction results obtained as fast as possible. It is a matter of fact proven by numerous researchers that assets derivatives behave differently being observed in small, medium, and long-term frames. Algorithms for predicting the dynamics of stock options and other assets derivatives for both small times (where one plays on market fluctuations), and medium ones (where trade is stressed at the beginning and closing moments) are well developed, and trading robots are actively used for these purposes. Analysis of the dynamics of assets for very long time-frames (of order of several months and years) is still beyond the scope of analysts as it is expensively prohibited, although this issue is extremely important for hedging the investments portfolios. The present paper focuses on construction of an effective and resource-intensive model for predicting the behavior of financial instruments, trends and price movements based upon the principles of deep learning. The forecasts obtained by the model showed an almost acceptable compliance with the true prices of the S&P500. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates a continuous-time monetary asset-pricing model of the term structure of nominal interest rates. In a pure exchange economy with incomplete information, investors cannot observe the expected growth rates of both exogenous real output and money supply. Therefore, they apply dynamic Bayesian inference. The model obtains explicit solutions for equilibrium prices of consumption goods and nominal bonds, and the stochastic process of an investor's beliefs. The dependence of term premia on beliefs allows the model to introduce a GARCH property, which interacts with the volatility of the macro variables. In particular, the volatility of excess returns is inversely related to noise in the macro variables, suggesting that their imprecise information does not increase fluctuations in interest rates. Using beliefs as the factor of uncertainties in economic states, the model also shows that there is a negative correlation between the new measure of uncertainty and the velocity of money, consistent with Friedman's explanation that demand for money for precautionary motives has a negative impact on the velocity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},
